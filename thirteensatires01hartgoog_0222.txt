(verse 112) and iu x. 65: “duc in Capitolia magnum Cretatumque
bovem.’' Itis tbe ordinary'word for marrying a wife li. 22), for
moulding a statue (vii. 237), tor burying the dead (i. 146; x. 240),
for drawing lots (vi. 583), ior dragging by the heels (v. 1253 x, 66),
for spinning (xii. 66), for contracting (as we say· of a stain, etc.) (xiii.
216); Juvenal also uses it for stealing (xiii. 152). In many of its
significatione ‘trahere' is used synonymously with it (verse 11).
‘Quippe ferox vitulus,' ‘sure 'tis a wild steer.'

11. Pinyuior Hispulla] He says r his means were equal to his affec·
tion he would offer a bull latter than Hispullae woman of whom noth-
ing definite is known. The beast should be hardly able to carry its
own weight (a prize ox), not reared in the pasturas about Rome, but
a white beast whose breeding (sanguis) should show that he came
from tbe Clitumnus. This was a small stream in Umbria, which flowed
through'a valley rich in pasture-land, aud celebrated lor a breed of
peculiarly white sheep and cattle. The stream was held in religious
veneration, and there were many small temples near the source. For
this reason and from their color, the animala bred on the banks were
commonly used for sacrifice.

14„ a prandi cervixserieada ministra] ‘Sanguis ’ and ‘cervix' stand

the viatim on the head with a hammer to stun it, and then to cut the
throat‚ or chop the neck with an axe. The viatim was ‘mactata'
atter the blow of the hammer, which was administered hythe ‘popa ;’
the ‘ cultrarius’ probably was a lower officer who flnished the busi-
ness. Juvenal speaks of him asaburlyfellow, ‘grandi' The gerun-

15. trepidantis adhuc] Though the danger was past he was still ,

trembling at the remembrance ot* what he had lately gone through.

19. impulit ionia] This probably refers to the meteoric tlashes
known in the Med1terrsnean as the tire of St. Elmo. ‘Quum cre
deret’ is a relative clause denoting result: ‘it was such a time that each
believed himself struck! ‘Attonitus 'is a stmnger word ior ‘ terri·

23. si quando poetica serpit] When a storm is gotten up in poetry all

24. Genua ecce alind discriminis :1 ⁴ But here is another kind of dan·
ger,' which he relates at verse 30, introducing it with a little mock
seriousness and a parenthesis about pictures of wrecks. The practice
of shipwrecked sailors hanging up pictures in the temples (ot Isis in
