p 4it). pergit non reddere nummos] “'Persists in not restoring money de·
osi e

with him.'' This is the offence that gave occasion ior S. xiii.
The next line is repeated from the 13'lth oi that satire. '

42. qni lites inchoet aranos] “ Ι must wait ior some mdeiinite time that ¹
shall even make a beginning oi the causes of an entire people.'' So
Heinrich takes it, and Ι see no better way. ‘Annus totius populi' 1
can make no meaning of. ‘Annus' is probably a definite word ior an
indefinite period. ‘inchoare' is commonly used for such a beginning
as is not brought to an end; and ‘tunc quoque,' etei, means that no
more than a beginning is made or likely to be made.

44. toties subsellia tantam] This means that the court was ready,
onslrions on the scats, and everybody there, but the advocates loitered.
The case must therefore wait.

46. parati Digredimur] This is the language oi the. amphitheatro.
“ Prepared to fight, we are obliged to separate, and the iorum is but a
slew arena for our oombat.” ‘Balteus’ was a belt which went over
the shoulder and held the sword. ‘Sufflamine' is used in viii. 148
ior a drag, and it is here used in that sense figuratively.

51. testandi militibus jus] Under the Roman law all that a son ac-
quired who was not free from his father’s power by emancipation or
death was acquired for his father, and be had no power of making a

Ι will. About the time of Augustusan exception was made in favor of

money acquired through military service, which 'was called ‘castrense
peculium.’ Whatever a son had while be was ‘in patria potestate'
was ‘peculium' and with certain modificatione was held on the same
terme as a slave’s (iii. 189, n). In the time ot Constantine the
same privilege that attached to the ‘castrense peculium,' or money
carried in military service, was extended to money earned in civil
offices, which was therefore called ‘quasi castrense peculium.' This,
as Heinrich says, is an argument in lavor of the satire having been
written before the time oi Constantine, nn. 306. ‘Non esse in corpore
census’ means that it was not part of the property which was under
his tather’s control. ‘Placuit' means only that it is settled law. The

ς . legal word ior ‘regimen' is ‘potestas'

54 Ergo Coronam Signornm comitem] Horace (S. ii. ὅ) refers to the

story of one Nasica, a fortune-humer, who was laughed at by one .

Coranus. The name Coranus seems to have become proverbial in
this connection. This man, because hc has got money oi his own
which he has the power to dispose ol, is courted by his own father,
trembling with years, in hopes he may survive his rich son yet, and
get something by his will. ‘Captare' is the common word in this

s.
segg. Hanc labor moos] There is no sense in this. So'me think
‘labor' should be ‘faron' This is the only conjecture that has thrown
light on the passage. ‘Pulcro labori’ is the same as ‘labore militiae'
above (verse 52). ‘Hunc' refers to the former oi the two persons, a
not uncommon usage.

58. dacis hoc referre videtur] This use of the genitive with ‘referre’
is easily understood by resolving ‘ referre' into its parts, ‘rem ferre ·'
