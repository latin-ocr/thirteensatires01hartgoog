have been preserved from that day, and would justly be called ‘anti-
qui! The use oi round tables introduced a change in the distribution
of the company usual in Horace's time, which was on the triclinium,
or three long couches round a table of three sides to correspond to
them. The round tables did not suit this arrangement, and semicin
cular couches were introduced, with sewer people on them. In large
houses there would bc several oi these in a room. Seneca had five
hundred tables of citrus wood with ivory feet. Thia was avery costly
wood, with veins and spots of great beauty. Each table was made ot'
one slah, cut across the grain. The largest known was about four
anda half feet in diameter. Some such tables were sold ior more
than stenen each.

139. Nullus jam parasitus erit .·] ‘We shall soon have no parasites;
but who shall bear to seo this selfish gluttony of yours i' Hc addresses
the man. ‘Luxuriae sordes' means avarica and luxury combined.
‘Ponere ' is the word used for putting dishes on the table. At large
banquets a boar served up whole, aud sometimes staffed with all
manner of forced meat and rich things, was usually the chief dish.

144. intestata] As he madano will his property would go to his ‘hes
redes,' not to ‘amici' Peacocks first came into fashion in Cicero’s
time. In the days os Pericles they were so rare in Greece that visitors
cameto Athens from Sparta and Thessaly to see the birds end buy
eggs; a pair oi birds then cost lance drachmae. The common prac-
tice οἳ bathing immediately alter meals, though in hot baths, might
well lead to sudden dsatlrs and to frequent intestacy, as Juvenal ex-
presses it. ‘Ducere iunus’ isone of the many applicatione ol that
verb. See below on xii. 8.

146. plaudendum] They do not even pretend to be sorry.

149. Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit] “Allvice is at its height ’'
(Stapylton). ‘⁴ All vice is at its zenith '' (Gifford). ‘f All vice is at
ita pitch-pole'' (whatever that may be) is Holyday's version. The
notion is, that vice is at a point from which it can climb no highea
and that the age is on the brink of a precipice, and likely to be ruined

Uene velis, Totos pande sinae] He addresses his Musa as a ship‚ and
hids her set all sail. For the hiatus in the next verse, see on iii. 70.
On ‘liberet’ consult A. 59, 5, h; H. 486, ὃ ; A. a S. 264, 12.

15³, Simplicitas] This seems to bsequivalent to the Greek παρρησία,
and to* mean “bluntness.” Mayor and others punctuate so asto
make ‘ Cujus -nont’ a specimen of this ‘simplicitas’ as practised
by Lucilius. ‘Cujus' is then, oi course, the interrogative.

154. Quid refert dictis iquoscat Mucius] The man is supposed to ask,

‘What does it signify (refert, rem serti whether you might attack , ,

Mucius with impunity, as Lucilius did, or nott Introduce Tigellinus, .
and you will be served as the Christiana were! ‘Pone' means, per·
