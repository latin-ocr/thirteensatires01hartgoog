sarran 111. 119

how small a portion of our dregs are from Greecel’ ‘ Quota' with
‘pars' (or here! portio') generally significa ‘bow small a part.' ‘Quo-
tus' is the question which is answered by an ordlual numeral (M. 74,
obs. 2; A. dr S. 119, ra), and ‘quota pars' means properly, in a series
ot' graduated parts what place would the thing occupyl and the ini·
plication is that it would come very late in the series. ‘Whatb par't'
(if we had aucha-word) would express ‘quota pars,' as ‘septima pars‚'
‚‘octava‚' etc, would be the seventb‚ eighth, etc, part.

“ 62. in Tiberim deflrtm't Orontes] The Orontes is here put generally
ior the province of Syria, which was added to the Roman dominicus
hy Cn. Pompeius, rac. 65. Its own trade, and that of tbe East to
which it opened a wider door, brought to Rome that inllux of slaves
of which J uvenal complains. The Orientale bave little or no ear for
music; and on lower ground than Umbricius takes, lie might have
run away from the musio oi Eastern flageolets, harps, and drums.
They were probably such as are still in use all over Asia, and no dis·
cord is comparable to tbat which is there listened to with satisfaction.
The first instrument bas usually but two or three holes, and no steps,
and the last (corresponding to the lndian tomtom) is beaten with no
perceptible reference to time. The sort of harp here mentioned was
called ‘sambuca' and it was triangular, which is meant by ‘obliquas'
The Circus Maximus had vaults under it, which were occupied by
prostitutes. ‘dussas' means that they werc hired for the purpose by
others, wbo made gain of their prostitution. Forths construction,
, see i. 99, note. ‘Ite’ means ‘go thither!

66. picta lupa barbara mitral] ‘Pictos' like ratibor, means ‘em-
broidered.’ The women in Rartern Asia do not wear any thing on
their head but a veil to draw over their face. The ‘mitra' a sort of
light turban, belonged to the women of Syria and Asia Minor. The ,
effeminate Romans took to wearing it. It is always associated with
them or with harlots. Why these persons should be called by a name
which means a she-wolf is obvious. According to Livy, the story of
Romulus and Remus being nursed hya wolf is founded on their hav-
mgG'sllmRZedliglse abllzetvasutss]olflea affilffigrh'zes Romulus. Of ‘ trechedipna’
the Scholiast says they were Greek shoes (caligulae) worn by para·
sites running to dinner. The derivation from τρέχειν and δεῖπνον is
obvious enough ; and whatever the things were, the context shows
they were Greek. Thut they were shoes may be inferred from the
name. ‘Rusticus' does not here mean a rustic literassy, but the de-
scendants of rustics.

68. Et cwomon'coseit niceteria collo] ‘ceroma' (κὴρωμα) was a prep
oration oi clay, cil, and wax, with which the Greek wrestlcrs were
anointed. ‘Niceteria’ (νικητὴρια) here means tbe prizes oi victory for
wrestling‚ a practice introduced at Rome under the empire. The
early Romans despised the Greek gymnastic exercises‚ and Nero was
the first to build a public gymnasium or trainiug school for wrestlers,
etc. Juvenal mentions this as one 01 the discreditable Greek innova-
tions. Hs uses Greek words designsdly.
