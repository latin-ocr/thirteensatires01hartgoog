sarran xm.. 215

95, Et phthisis et vomicae patres] ‘Consumption and putrid abscesses
and a broken leg' (xv. bi, m).

96. Summitti] ‘Tanti' may be translated “ are worth bearing,’'
where we understand readily that they are worth bearing for the sake
of money. It may nothe easy to extract this meaning i'rom the seu-
tence grammatically, but Madvig (in his ‘Opusoula'l has shown by
abundant examples that ‘tanti,' which at first meant the worth oi the
thing ior which a price is given, came conventionally to be joined with
the price itseli as here. An instance oi the primary use ot' ‘ tanti' is
found in iii. 54: “Tanti tibi non sit opaci Omnis arena Tagi-ut
somno careas.’' Madvig refers to x. 97 : “ Sed quae praeclara et pros·

· pera tanti Ut rebus laetis parsit mensura malorum i'' but Ι have fol·
lowed the common reading ‘tantum ' there. ,

97. Nec dubitet Ladas] Not even Ladas would hesitate to pray for
the rich man's gout, unless he ia mad. There were two celebrated
Greek runuers oi this name, which was proverbial in this line. Gout,
it appears, has always been the rich man's disorder. Archigenes was
a physioian. The final ‘e' is long, corresponding to the Greek form
ῇ. Anticyra was a town oi Phocis, the neighborhood oi which
abounded in helleboro, the supposed remedy ior insanity. Horace
alludes to it more than once. ’

99. Pisaeae ramus elisaei] The plain oi Olympia, in which the
Olympio gemes were held, was very little west oi the town oi Pisa in
Elis, and the names are sometimes coniounded. It was at these garues
that both the Ladae on record won their prizes. His success cost one
oi them his life. The branch oi the olive which, as before mentioned,
was used ior the crowns at Olympia (viii. 226, n), Juvenal calls
‘hungry ’ because it bore no fruit.

100. Ut sit magna taurea] “But grant the wrath oi heaven ir great,

it certainly is slow.'' The speaker reverses the Greek proverb: “ Ὀψὲ
θεῶν didacus μύλοι, ἀλέουσι ὁὲλεπτίιθ

“Though the mills oi God grind slovvly, yet they grind exceeding'
Thgldgall with patience grinde He ever, still exactly grinde He all.'’'

¹ As to ‘diadema' see viii. 259, n. Itis not hard to find cases in point.

The Scholiast is saie and goes back as iar as Romulus.

103. solet his ignoscere] ‘¹ He is wont to pardon such faults as
these.'' This is the common salve ior conscience. Men make most
allowance lor their own besetting sins, and think the Almighty does
so too. . They think also they can get pardon whenever they please
for askrng, and so they put off the asking; and few think otherwise
than that their own day of account is some way off. To make a lot·
tery oi wickedness, and trust to prizes turning up and risk the fatal
blank, is common enough. Solomon, who understood these matters,
says z “ Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily‚
therefore the heart of the sons oi menis fully set in thern to do evil ''
(Eccles. viii, 11). When the heart ‘is ‘⁴ trepidum formidine culpae,'’
trembling with iear oi its own great galli, it would seem the shortest
and easiest course to abandon it; but it is more convenient to e ··
