tc be the famous statue oi Memnon, from which it was believed that V

sounds propeeded at the rising oi the sun produced by the impression
of his rays. Strabo mentions them, but says that part of one had

. fallen owing toan earthquake, and that from the part that remained

in its place a sound such as might proceed thoma hlow was heard once
a day. He himseli heard it, and where it came irem he professes to
be ignorant, hut he is not inclined to believe it issued from the stone.
Pausanias, who visited-the statue, found it broken as Strabo described
it, and says it was supposed to have been broken by Cambyses. He
compares the eound to the snapping of a lrarp·string. Strabo wrote
. during the liic oi our Saviour, Pausanias at least a hundred an'd flny
years alter Strabo. Juvenal may have seen the statue about halt a
century before Pausanias. ln his time, however, the statue which has
since been restored vves mutilated, which is the meaning of ‘dimidia’
as below, verse 56, “vultus Dimidios,'’ and viii. 4, “Curios yam„ ,
dimidios.’' ‘Magicae chordae ' imphes that Pausanias described the
sound according to popular notione. Itis generally supposed to have
been a trick of the priests executed by some simple mechanical con-
trivance. The statue supposed to be that of Memnon shows evident
marks of having been restored, the body from the waiet upwards being Ι
oi several pieces and of a different stone from the legs and pedestal,
which are a monolith. When this restoration took place is unknown.
Itis attributed by Heeren to Septimius Severus, who restored some
of the Egyptian menutnents. His reign was from an. 193 to 211. The
height is about fifty ieet, and that oi the pedestal six ieet. Memnon,
theson of Eos and Tithonus, was a Greek adaptation from the name
of several Egyptian kings, Phamenoth or Amenophth. The priests’
jugglery may have arisen out of the fabulous birth the Greeks at·
tributed to Memnon as son of the morning. ,

6. Atque oetas Thebe] The notion that ancient Thebes had a hundred
gates was derived from Homer, and was received like other poetieal
fables by the Greeks and Romans without much inquiry. Thebes was
perhaps the most ancient town of Egypt, and was originally the me·

. tropolis and residence of the kings whose tombs are among the aston-

ishing ruins that remain to this day. The Persians under Cambyses
about ae. 520 pillaged and partly destroyed the temples and burnt the
private dwellings. Its downsall was completed about rae. 85, when,
the inhabitants having revolted from Ptolemy Lathyrus, it was taken
after a three years' siege and pillaged. Strabo describes it asin his
day a city oi ruins covering a space of eighty stadia (ten miles) in
circuit, while the inhabitants occupied, as they do still, a few villages
on each side of the river. The effect of the ruins is usually described
as overpowering. One sentence of Belzoni’s expresses this effect:
“It appeared to me like enteringa city of giants, who after along
conflict were all destroyed, leaving the ruins of their various temples
as the only root of their former existence.’'

7. Illic uellerea] ‘Aelurus' is the Greek word fora cat (αἱλουρος).
This animal was chiefly worshipped in the city of Bubastis on the
Pelusiae branch of the Nile. lt was sacred to the goddess Pasht, cor·
