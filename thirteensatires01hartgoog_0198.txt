enormous wealth, which he offered to the emperor as a gift at a time
when he knew that his enemies were successfully conspiring against
him. Within laur years 01 Nero’s accession he was said to have
amassed abacto sestertia, which is nearly alnooocoo. He was re
, turning srom Campania, and had stopped at his villa four miles from
Rome, when a tribune was sent by Nero to obtain his answer to the

charge on which his 1110 depended. The tribune entered while Seneca ’

w'as at dinner with his wisc and two friends, having first placed a
guard round the house, which Juvenal here refers to. Plautius Late·
sanus, like Seneca, was put to death as a party to Piso’s conspiracy
against Nero. He was consul designatus. The change of tense in
‘obsidet’ seems to be sor metrical reasons alone. Juvenal applies to
all three what is strictly true of Seneca alone.

19. arpenti vasculo pari‚] ‘Argentum purum’is silver without any
figures or chasing. ·

2³, Prr'masere vora] “ The first and most familiar prayers.'’ ‘Opes'
here is simply wealth. ‘Ut maxima toto nostra sit arca foro' means
that each wishes to have the largest balance in his hanker's hands.
The ‘argentarii' carried on their business iu the forum. Those who
had considerable deposits with them, it appears, had each his own
caah-box. ‘Ut' introduces au obJ'ect clause. See h. 70, 3, a; H. 492, 8. .

27. Setinum] ‘Ardebit' applies to the brightness 01 the wine, not
itss irit.

23. Jamne icitur hardas] “ Ι)ο you not after this think it well that 01
the sages onc,’·' etc. The laugher was Democritus 01 Abdera; the
weeper, Heracleitus. The former liourished at the beginning 01 the
fifth century ac. ; the latter a little earlier, at Ephesus. The enclitic
‘ne' seems tc be used in the sense 01 ‘nonna’ though the grammars
(H. 346, 11.,1‚ 1; M. 451, a; Z. 3521011010 it only the meaning 01
‘num ’ when added to any other word than the verb. ¹See verse 90,
wfhere it is joined to the verb, and certainly seems to have the force
o ‘num'

³1. Sed facilis etrier’s rioldi] 1-10 says any one can laugh; the only
wonder is where the weeper got all his tears. ‘Rigidi cachinni ' is a
hard sardonic laugh; the genitive is appositional. See iii 4, n.

³5. Praetexta et trabeae] As to these, which were tho togas worn by
senators and* magistrates, see 0111209, n. He says in those cities in
which Democritus spent his time and his wit, there were noue 01 the
great abuses 01 the present time, the iniquities and sslf-indulgence 01
the great and rich, and the corruption 01 justice.

³6. Praetorem can-ihus altis] See viii. 194, n. He is giving a mock
description 01 the Ludi Circenses, which the praetor presided over.
These were receded by a grand procession, in which the praetor rode
in 0, triumphat chariat with all the insignia 010 triumph. What
follows is a description 010 triumph. ‘Tunica J ovis' was a tunic worn
only on triumphat occasions ; it was kept in the Capitol, and had its
name from this. It was also called ‘tunica palmata, either became rt
was embroidered with palm brancher, or because it had a stripe

(clarus) apalm in breadth. ‘Sarrana' is Tyrian, that is‘purple.'
