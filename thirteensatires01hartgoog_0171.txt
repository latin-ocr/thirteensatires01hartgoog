compositione in the porticos attached to the temples. Juvenal says
these misguided poete leit the usual places os recitation to accept irom

· a shabby patron a dirty raom anda packed audience.

38. Ipsefacr't casas] This scurvy patron himself affecte to be a oet Ἴ
interior to Homer only for tlte reverencc due to ltis antiquity; aad), to
show that he has apoet's sympathies, helends his poor brothera dirty
roam, which had long been locked up as fast as the gates of a town
when tlte enemy is coming. He also gives him a saw of his depend-
ente to sit at the end of the room and in different parts to applaud
him ; but he leaves him to go to the expense oi hiring his own benches
and oi the porterage. ‘Recites' is used intransitively. For the form,
see A. 59, t, a ; M. 370; A. da S. 261, R. 2. The same construction ·
occurs in verse 50.-

‘djst' Haec lorpeserrata] The interpretem properly explain ‘longe’ as
ru.

46. pendent anabathra moilla] The room is supposed to be arranged
like a theatra, with ‘ subsellia,' which are benches placed about the
room on the floor; ‘anabathra' or benches rising one above the-other
at the sides of the room; and aa orchestra, reserved seats near the
speaker. The orchestra in a Greek theatro was the circulor space in
iront oi the stage occupied by the chorus. Ia Roman theatres, which
nearly resembled the Greek, the orchestra was given up to the accom-
- modation of senators and magistrates and other persons oi distinction.
Herc the recitet put chatra for his more important auditore. ‘Con-
ducto anabathra tigillo' is equivalent to ‘conducta anabathra tigil-
lahria,’ hired scats ot' plank. ‘Posita est,' the orchestra is set out with
carrs. ·
¹ 48. Nos tamen loc opimata] See above, verse 20. What follows are
proverbe for labor thrown away.

52. scribendi cacoethes] ‘Cacoetlres,' which properly means no more

, than a bad habit, was applied medically to inveterateulcers aad

cancere. .

5³. publica rena] ‘Publica' is, like acad, that which belongs to all,
commonplace ; ‘expositum' means such as you would meet with in
the highway‚ antl so is ‘triviale' In ‘vena' the metaplror is taken
from mines. ‘Deducere' is commonly applied to verse-making, and
is probably taken from apinning. Tho works of the brain are com-
monly in most languages described as the coinage of a mint; and
Juvenal speaks of thc man whose ideas are not coined at the common
mint, in which all manner oi base metal is struck, and then pasees cur-
rent among the ignorant. The temple of duno Moneta (from rnoneo,
corresponding to Μνηιιοσὺνη) was the Roman mint. Both ‘money'
and ‘mint' are derived from the word. ·

56. sentio tantam] He says he cannot point out such a person3 he
can only imagine, or, as hc says better, feel him. ‘Impatiens acerbi'
expresses ἄγευστος neapol, not impatient, bat free from the suffering of
bitterness, which is that of povcrty, disappointment, mortification, and
aelf-contempt. The Muses had their name Aonides from Boeotia,
anciently called Aonia. Bacchus and the Muses are always close
companium, and so he says ‘ thyrsum contingere!
