208 noras.

Romans first used elephants ln the var against Philip of Macedon, ·
ao. 200. This was tlte year aiter the conclusion oi the second Punic
war, in which Livy says these elephante were taken. Pliny says
that elephanta were first exlribited iu tlre Circus in the year ac. 99.
The last syllable in ‘belli' (verse 110) is preserved from elision.

111„ Nullo igitar mora per Not-ima] This means that Novius and
Pacuvius (who may be anybody) are uite ready, and the difficulty is
not on their part n it is not done, ιο offer elephante on the altar oi Gal·
lita’s Lares. On the use oi ‘quim' see A. 65, l, b; Μ. 375, c; Z. 543.

115. Alter enim, et concedas] ‘Enim ' means they would not hesitate
about an elephant, for one oi them would be quite ready ιο offer
human sacrifices ior the lite oi the rich woman, or even his own child,
as Agamemnon did, though he could not expect her ιο be delivered
and a lrind substituted in her place, as the story is about Iphigenia.
‘Tragicae' means that this is the story in the Tragedians. The offence
requiring ‘piaculum’ was that Agamemnon had not tulfilled a vow he
had made to Artemis to offer to her the most beautiful thing that
should be born in the year his daughter was born ; lte or the Argives
had aleo shot a hind loved by Diana For the ‚subjunctive iu ‘'conce·
das,' see references on x. 142. ‘Pueris et frontibus ancillamm' is ior
‘frontibus puerorum et ancillarum! t

121. Lorrrb meam civem] So the master commended the unjust
steward because hevae vrsein his generatiou. He says ironically
that the satety oi a thousand ships (referring, perhaps, to Agamem·
non's lieet, ior the saiety ot which he sacriflced his daughter) is noth· ,
ing compared with a vill, for it the sick man recovers he will unmake
his will, caught in the snare ot the fisberman. ‘Nassa’ is a snare
made of osier, and so contrived that the fislr that got in could not get
out again. ‘Libitina' was the goddess ot funerals and all things per·
tainiug to the dead. She is identified by some authors with Proserpina,
andb others with Venus.

12 Post meritum sane mirandum] Alter a service truly astonishing,
that is the effectual vows ol Pacuvius, to which he is ready to attrib
ute his recovery. For this service, he will perhaps. make him his
sole ‘heres' (heres ex asse). ‘Breviter,' ‘in iew words) ‘Rivalibus’ ·
is here used in an uncommon way. xlts demved sense elsewhere has
refereuoe only ιο rivalry in love.

126. Ergo uides mam Grande] “So you see what a return for his
sufferiugs the death oi one Mycenaeae damsel won.'' He supposes
him ιο have bada ‘nubilis iphigenia,' and ιο have sacrificed her, and
to have had his trouble soothed by the fruits of his devotion in the
old man's vill. iphigenia is represented 'm the story as having been
sent tor to Aulis by her father under the pretence that she was ιο be
married to Achilles. ‘Mycenis' is an adjective.

128. vet Nestora totam] See x. 246. “Let him live a vhole
Nestor.” The accusative is that of kindred signification. Nero’s
motto was: “Hoc agamus ne quis quidquam habeat,'' “let it be our
endeavor that no one shall have any thing.'' He robbed provinces, aud
he robbed rich citizens. No one could call his money his own.
