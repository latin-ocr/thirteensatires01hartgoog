x . Lutra OF JUVENAL.

dangcrous voyage, and is more cf the nature of a familiar
letter than of a Satire. The dishonesty os the age isde-

scribed in the thirteenth Satira, which contains some of ¹

Juvenal's finest verses, and shows him in the best char-
acter. This also is in the form of an epistlc to a friend,
and so is the eleventh‚ 'which contains an invitation to
dinner and contrasts the poet’s own plainness of living
with the luxurious habits of his contemporaries Thus

. Juvenal goes through all the great scandala of his day,

and treats them unsparingly. The crimes and criminals
of former reigns are freely introduced by way of illustra·
tion‚ but this is because the vices of one reign represented
those of another, and the names of the dead could be
more safely used than of the living. Tiberius, Caligula,
claudius, Nero, Otho, Domitian, are all brought up from

time tc time to pointa moral or illustrate seme aspect cf ⁴

crime.

The most celebrated of J uvenal’s poema, the tenth, has
more of the declamatory character, which some cf his
critica attribute to all. Itis on the vanity of human
wishes, which is illustrated chiefly by historica] examples, -
and the poem has not much bearing upon the particular
character of his times. Itis the finest specimen of that
sort of composition that I am acquainted with. The
fifteenth Satira is connected with a scene cf little general .
interest, an Egyptian squabble, J uvenal's own interest in
which can only bc accounted for by his having been in the
country where it happened. The last Satire, isit had been
completcd‚ would have fumished a sketch of military life,
sarcastic but good-humored, from which a good deal of
informaticn might have been derived.
