Lura OF JUVENAL. ¹ Χ lx
N.
Hadrian an. 138, when Juvenal was, according 10 Ν ·
sketch, eighty or a little more. , ,χ
Thusthe statements 01 the Grammcri'ans in respect to “ , l
the poet's age, and 01 that writer who says he died 01 old
age in the time 01 Antoninus Pius, would be· borne ont.
Ihave also allowed the fact 01 an honorable banishment
into Egypt, though not the cause assigned by the Gram-
marians (the supposed attach on the pantomimo Paris),
which is impossible. That Juvenal did not professedly
composa satire‘ till late in lise, is admitted and accounted
fer. Likewise that he may have written verses before he·
ventnred to publish them, and that some 01 these were
afterwards incorporated with his Satires, is allowed. It is
v also admitted that he attended the usrral schools in early
life, and practised rhetoric till middle age. Beyond these
facts the Grammarians, I believe, have been misled.
Independently 01 the chronological difficulties in respect
' 10 Paris, it does not appear that the verses quoted hy the
Grammarians (vii. 90-92) were ever intended as asatire 011
him, but if any thing as a compliment. So at least they
appear in the connection in which we have them. And it ,,
is· periectly clear that in that connection they could not (³
have given offence to the emperor, whoever he vessinae 1
’ the ¹Satira sets out from the first with such preire as the
worst 01 these princes coveted and rewarded, praise for .
his exclusive support 01 learning. If therefore it had been ¹
possible to admit these verses as the cause 01 Domitian’s -
displeasure, it must have been when they appeared sepa·
rately as an epigram, or with a different context from the
present, which it must be admitted they do not very well
snit, if, as seems certain, the rest 01 the Satira was written
long aiter Paris’s death.
