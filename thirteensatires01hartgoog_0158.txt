ssrmu iv. 139

112. Fuscus] Cornelius Fuscus was employed by Vespasian in high
commanda, and by Domitian as ‘praelectus' of the praetorian troops.
He was sent by him on an expedition against the Daci, and was killed,
together with the greater part oi his army, by that people. Tacitus
describes him (in mn. 69) as ‘vigens aetate, claris natalibus,’ and as
one who loved danger ior its own sake. Juvenal says he thought of
battles in his marble villa; retirement and the degrading lil‘e oi a
Roman senator of this day did not suit him, and he was glad, οο doubt,
to be em loyed on the rough service in which he lost his lile.

113. cicuta Catulla] Fabricius Veiento, whom he calls ‘crafty,' is
mentioned above, iii. 185. Eliny describes Catullus as blind and of a
savage disposition. He had neither reverence, modesty, nor pity, aud
so Domitian used him, as a man uses arrows, to shoot at 011 the best
oi men. ’

116. dirusque α ponte satelles] The man was one who should 11010
been found begging on the Appia Via of the passengers in their car-

Aricia, it went down into the Vallis Aricina, and the descent was
called Clivus Aricinus. It appears that beggars were in the habit of
posting themselves at the top of this hill. On the construction with
‘Dignus’ see A. 65, 2, f ; H. 501, 111.; B. 1226.

119. rhombum sturmin} See A. 52, 1, a3 H. 371, 3, 1; B. 716.

121. Sic paphus Cilicis 10010101] 11 appears that Cilician gladiators
were common. ‘Pegusa' which has its name from the Greek πηγ-
νὺναι, was used for different things made of wood, but in connection ,
with 1110 theatro. ‘Pegmata' were great wooden structures which
formed stages; and had two or more stories, which let up and down
by machinery. Upon these gladiators fought, and other exhibitione
took place. The ⁴ velaria' were an awning drawn over the seats oi
the amphitheatra 10 keep 001 the sun and rain. By some ingenious
contrivance, it appears, a boy was suddenly carried up 10 the awning
from the ‘pegma’ for the amusement of the spectators3 and this
blind flatterer pretended to admira a thing he could not see, just as
now he admires the fish, looking to the leit where it was not.

127. Excidet Aruiragus s] There is no British prince oi this name on

record contemporary with Domitian. The man is talking nonsense, ’

aud'knows it. ‘Aut’ means ‘or at least'

129. Fabricio] This was Veiento's 00010. The Fabricio gens was
plebeian, butan old family.

130. Quidnam icitur censes 1] The question is put in the usual ior-
mula 1ο 1110 senate. On ‘conciditur,' see once more iii. 296, n. “I
suppose it must be cut up.’'

133. Prometheus] He means 0 potter. ‘Castra’ like ‘praetorium'
may mean the palace.

- 1³6. Vicit] This is the usual word. His proposal was carried.

1³7. noctesque Neronis] Suetonius says oi Nero (c. 27), “Epulas a
· medio dicad mediam noctem protrahebat; refotus saepius calidis
piscinis, ac tempore aestivo nivatis.'' Like others, he was wont, it
