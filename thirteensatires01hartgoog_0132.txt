great men you will suffer for it. ‚Sophronias Tigellinus (whose name
is used proverbially) was Nero's chief favorite, and his accomplice in
the burning of Rome. 'The origin of the lire was traced to his house.
Το avert fiom himself and his friend the odium of this crime, Ner0‚ as

' is well known, charged it upon the Christiane, who were put to death

in great numbers and in the most cruel fashion. Among other tor·
ments they were hung up on crosses, tarred‚ and set on fire by way of
torches. ‘Taeda' herc means either a pitched shirt, called below
‘tunica molesta’ (viii. 235), or the pine wood with which they were
burnt. Juvenal represents the poor wretches with a stake thrast
under their chin.

157. Et latum medio sulcum deducis] The variety oi readings, aad
still greater variety of conjectures, in respect to ‘deducis' involve the
passage in almost hopeless difficulty· It seems to mean: ‘¹ After you
have been burned in the fire, you will be dragged through the midst ¹
of the arena, making a broad furrow.'' The present for the future
represents the action as if now going oa. Another explanation is
that the ‘sulcus 'ie a stream or gutter formed by the melted pitch
running off the man's body on the ground. I do not see how ‘ sulcus’
can have that meaning. Madvig reads ‘ deducit? and derives a nom-
inative (quae taeda) from what goes before, and then supposes the

Ι furrow to be formed in the earth by a number of victims buried up to

their waists in along row and aet on lire. Some take the meaning
to he ploughin the sand and wasting labor.

158. Quid it ergo] The satirist'replies to the advice just given?
His friend speaks again in ‘Quum - poenitet) ‘Pensilibus plurnis'
means a ‘lectica' with soft sectiles-bed and eushions, raised aloft on
men’sshoulders.

hand of Paris3 and Hylas isat the bottom of the well with his pitcher,

and Hercules sought him long, sorrowing and calling upon his name,
and set the people of the country (Mysia) to ¹seek him; a subject
much handled by the old poete. On the rhetorical figure in ‘quae-
situs urnamque secutus‚’ see Η. 704, rv., 23 Α. dt S. 823, 4, (2).

167. tacito sudant praecordio culpa] A cold sweat coming over the
heart through the power of conscience and the fear of exposure is a
forcible description. ‘Praecordia' are the intestines rather than the
heart. In tirese passion and feeling had their seat, according ιο the
Romans ; the heart was the seat of intelligence.,

169. onte tubas :l Before the battle is began. When a man has put
· on his armar, it is too late to draw back. The substance of his friend's
advice is, that if he must write, he had better attack those who are
dead and gone; and the poet says he will follow his advice. .
