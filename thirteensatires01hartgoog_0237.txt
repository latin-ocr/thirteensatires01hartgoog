141. Quint gollinoefilius albae] The eggs of a white hen, it appears,
were held in higher estimation than others. The bird must have been
more or less rare, or the distinction would not have arisen. ‘Qui ' is
‘how' The epodosis for ‘si flectas' seems better supplied from
‘ serendam' than ironr ‘ pateris! ·

145. sulfure coepto Atque dola] ‘ Sulsure atque dolo' is one subject,
‘sulfure doloso ' or ⁶ cum dolo posito,’ sulphur stealtlrily laid, matches
perhaps like our own.

146. quum janna colligit ignes .·] These incendiary acts seem to have
been not uncommon. Accidentai or malicious flres were so frequent
that they are'counted among the vexatione of the city from which the
manin Sat. iii. chose to retire (verse ll. Nero plundered the temple
at Delphi, aud it is possible Juvenal had him in mind in the next
clause. '

150. minor exstat sacrilegus qai Rodot] ‘There starts up a petty tlrief
to serape the thigh oia gilt Hercules! This is the subjunctive oi tlre
pagasafflsggbsstcsssmruglrrl. ddd’mld'klffl sense out of this line as it
stands. He says, compare with your man those who carry off great

, venerable cups from temples. If these are not to be found, then

comes a thiei in a lower way, to serape the gilding from the statues.
Would he hesitate, seeing it is his wont to melt down an entire Jove?
‘Solitus’ must be wrong, I think. ·

154. mercatoremque veneni] ‘Mercatorem’ is equivalent to ‘empto-
rem’ here. The crime alluded to in the next line is ‘parricidium’
(viii. 213, n). Thouglr ‘parricidium ² included the murder of relations
to some distance in point os consanguinity‚ this punishment only
applied to the nrurderers of father or mother, grandfather or grand-
mother. ‘Fatis ' is the ablativo of qualit-y.

157. custos 'Gallicus Urbis] Rutilius Gallicus was Praefectus Urbi in
the reign oi Domitian. Respecting that office, see iv. 77, n. ‘Ibi' is
readily supplied with ‘consume' from ‘illinc ' in the next verse. As
to ‘quota pare,' see iii. 61, n. The name of Dornitian’s Gallicus is
used for the Praefectus Urbi of the day, whoever he was, ii the date
apparently pointed out by verse ll is the true one.

162. Quis tumidum φαίην] This is the disease known as goitre, or
by medical men as bronchocele. The sufferens were called ‘guttu-
rosi! Asto the swelledbreast in Meroe nothing is known. Some
commentators suppose Juvenal speaks from ohservation during his
residence in Egypt. Tacitus says oi the Germane that they all had

166, Nempe qrrool hoec dlis] ‘Nempe quod' assumes that the answer
