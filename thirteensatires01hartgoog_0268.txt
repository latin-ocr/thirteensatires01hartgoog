sarran xvr. 249 7

7. communia] That which all soldiers held in common. ‘Togatus'
is the common word for a civilian. ‘Immo' here is affirmative oi
what precedes, and introduces something more. Itis sometimes used
negatively according to the nature oi the sentence; but its common
‚use is to add some statement, reason, etc, in continuation and support
oi what goes before. ‘Ne' (from which ‘ut' must be supplied before
‘dissimulet' M. 462, b) seemsused to introduce an appositional clause.
If so, it must be used ior ‘ut non.' Compare M. 374; A. 70, 4,f; Z.
623. It may be explained in another way, as depending on an idea of
hindering to be supplied.

11. tumidis livoribus ‘’fffflllJ ‘offa’ which is used for a chop or other
piece ol mest, here means a swelling irorn a blow. ‘Livoribus' are
black contusione. ‘Medico nil promittente' means that the doctor
cannot warrant that the man will not lose his eye. .

13. Bardaicus judea datur] ‘Judex' is predicate. It is not certain
that ‘bardaicus' agrees, as many take it, with ‘calceus ' in this place.
Ι think it may be taken independently. ‘Calceus' will in that case be

ualilied like ‘surse' by ‘grandes' ‘ Calceus' was the general namo ’
2οτ a walking shoe or boot as opposed to others worn in the house, or
sandala which only covered the sole or were strapped on to the upper
pert oi the foot. Oi the latter sort were ‘caligae’ (verse 24) which
were heavy sandals with nails worn by the common soldiers as the
‘calceus' was worn hythe officere, though sometimes the officere wore
‘caligae' See iii. 821, n. The name ‘harduicus ' is said to be derived
from the Bardaei, an Illyrian people from whom this sort of military
shoe was taken. Juvenal says (according to the above) iia man
wishes to punish the soldier who has maltreated him, the judex as·

signed to him is a ‘harduicus' a great boot, and a pair of thick calves ¹

under a big bench; that is, he must carry bis csse into the carnp, and
it he is allowed a trial it will be a court-martial with a centurion ior
judex. ‘Judicem dare’ was properly said of the praetor, who could
appoint if he pleased a judex privatus to hear a private cass at the in·
stauos oi the plaintiff. It is usual to describe the centurione as stout
men. Juvenal speaks here of great benches to match the great legs.
All is in the rougb way. .

15. more Camilla] The days oi the old discipline when M. Furius
Camillus was dictator and besieged Veii (ao. 393).

17. Justissima Centesimum] Juvenal says that the centurione give
just judgrnent against a soldier, and it a man goes before them with
a good complaint he will get satisfaction. But he will find the whole
camp set against him, and his satisfaction will be worse for him than
his wrong. ‘Igitur’ serves to keep the sentences together: ‘Well
then the centurion will give just judgrnent! When he says ‘nec mihi
deerit‚’ he puts himself in the position of an injured civilian‚ as below,
verse 28, “non sollicitemus amicos.'' ‘Deerit must be read in two
syllables. ‘Querelae' is the genitive of quality, ‘a cause in which the
