rant 01 the greatness 01 the sin or olP the danger, but being certain of
death it he rejected her, and having some hope 01 escaping discovery,
at the sante time attracted by the great prizes within his reach, he
consoled himself with waiting 101 the future and enJ'oying the present
moment. 'l'he intrigue was carried on without any concealinent on
the part 01 Messalina3 but according to Tacitus it was Silius who
proposed to her that they should marry, and she with some reluctante,
iearing lest she should lose her hold upon him, consented. It suits .
Juvenat’s purpose to give a different version 01 the story, or he may
have heard and believed what lte says, that the man had no choice
but compliance or death. The whole matter is well discussed by Meri-
vale, v. tro-436, who should by all means be consulted here.

occurred. On the form 01 the conditional sentence, see A. 59, 4,t
and R.; H. 511, 11.‚ l ; B. 1271. The courtiers were in much perplex-
it'y as to how they should act 101 their own satety3 and finally the
marriage was reported to Claudius through two 01 his concultines.
After a good deal 01 hesitation Claudius ordered the death· os Silius,
who died without tear. Messalina would have escaped if Narcissus
had not pretended the emperor's orders and caused her to he put to
death. When the emperor war informed that she was dead he asked
no questions, but called ior his wine and went to dinner. ι
