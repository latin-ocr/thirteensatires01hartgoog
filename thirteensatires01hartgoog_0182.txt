ernian vm. 163

Why, a consul drives horses and takes care of them and frequents
low¹ tavems (llo-162). Such faults should·be left with boyhood.
The legateis to be found in the worst company; you would send to
the fields a slave who should act thus (loe-182). It is worse yet
when our great men go upon the stage and tight in the arena, choosing
disgrace (183-2105. Many were Nero’s crimes; but it was worst of
all when he sang in theatres, and strove for the parsley crown
(an-230). Catilina and Cethegus were free-bom, Cicero was
ignoble‚ yet he won a greater victory than Octavius. Marius, too,
and the Decii, and the last good king, were of lowly birth; aslave
saved the city, when the consul's sons would have betrayed it
(rel-268). You had better be the son of Thersites and like Achilles,
than be ,the son of Achilles and like Thersites. Go back as far as
you will, your pro enitor was at best a shepherd (269-275).

1. Stenunola quid socium fg, The Romans had in their ‘atria' waxen
busta of their ancestors, w 'ch were carried in all funeral processione
of the family. They had also tables of their pedigree, in which there
were portraits with wreatlrs twined about them; audon these were
inscribed the names and offlces of the persons represented. The
’ tables came to be called ‘stemmata' from these wreaths. ‘Pictos
,vultus' are the portraits on these genealogical trees. '

2. Sanguine censui] This construction of ‘censere' with the abla-
tive is not found in the writers before the empire. It is the ablativo
of value, and ‘longo sanguine censeri’ isto be valued at the worth
of a long line of ancestors.

3. startias in cruribus] See vii. 125, n.; x. 59. The only historice]
Aemilianus when this was written was the younger Scipio, who was
born of the Aemilia gens, an old patrician family. His father was
L. Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus, but he was ado ted by P. Cornelius
Scipio, the son of the elder Scipio Africanus. he full name of the
younger after his adoption was P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, to
which Africanus was afterwards added as an agnomen. The Curii
were 'a plebeian family, of whom Μ. Curius Dentatus was the first
distinguished member. Corvinus was a cognomen ol the Valeria
gens, avery' old family. The Galbae belonged to the Sulpicia gens,
which was patrician aud of great antiquity. ‘Jaur dimidios’ means
that they are broken in half. Other warren busta are supposed to
have lost an ann orto have a piece out of the shoulder.
¹ 6. generis rabrrlalp A great roll of his aucestors that the man is sup·
posed to keep. he commentators now are generally agreed in .
rejecting the next verse. Heinrich, who does so, supposes by ‘virga'
the inte olator meant a broom to keep the busts clean; the Scholiast
takes it or the ‘fascea’

' 8. Fumosae Equitum] In the middle of the ‘atrium' wasa ‘focus'
round which were the images of the Lares. The farrrily chart would
soon get smoked. A Dictator was in early times called ‘magister
p)opuIi,' as being elected by the ‘populus' or ‘curiae' With the

ictator was -always appointed another officer subordinate to him,
who was called ‘magister equitum,’ for what reason is not certain
