1. Natali, Corvino, die] The welcomiug oi the day that reminds us
of our birth, and assigning ιο it a gladness which it rarely inspires
alter ehildhood, is a conventionality as old as history. The Romans
irom the earliest times observed their birtlrdays and those ο1 their
rulers and great meu aud their friends, as religione holidays, with
prayers and sacrifices, as we have seen in the last satire, verse 84.
As to ‘caespes' turi altars were commonly used by persons ο1 moder·
ate means.

³. Niteam Reginca diluimus cynara ς] white victims were offered to
the gods above, and black to those below, χθόνιοι. Tire worship of
Juno Regina was brought from Veii by Camillus, according to Livy,
and a temple was built to her under that name on the Aventina. She
'who fought with the Gorgon (that ison her ‘aegis'l was Minerva,
to whom he has promised a like offering for the preservatiou ο1 his
friend. The gods to whom they offered on such occasions were per·
haps chosen rather arbitrarily‚ or circumstances might direct the
choica in some instances. But Jupiter, June, and Minerva were corn·
monly worshipped together. The temple on the Capitoline hill oon-
sisred of three parts, of which the middle was dedicated to Jupiter
Opt. Max„ that on the right to J uuo, and the other to Minerva. The
Gorgon Medusa, whose head Perseus cut off and Pallas laced upon
her ‘ aegis‚’ was by some traditione an inhabitantes Ainea, and so
Juvenal calls her ‘Maura' ‘Pugnanti Gorgone' is in construction
like ‘clipeo venientis et hasta' (xi. 106, where see note); i means
“fighting armel with the Gorgon '' as the other is “coming armed
with shield and spear.'’

⁵. Sed pronti aetenam] A young steer is tied end chaies at tho
length oi the rope, and shakes his head, waiting ιο be offered to Jupiter
Opt. lllax. It was considered a good omen, 11 the animal went will-
iugly to the altar. The Capitoline hill was also called 'Tarpeiau from
¹ the treacherous Tarpeia who betrayed the citadel on that hill to the
Sabinas. The precipitous part ο1 the hill from which criminale were
thrown was more especially known by that name. ‘Sed' means only
that another victim was reserved ior Jove ruore fitting thau the lamb.
‘Coruscare' is the same as ‘vibrare' Wiue was commonly poured
ou the head oi the victim before it was killed, and ou the parte that

were sacrificed while they were burning on the altar. They were ,

aab sprinkled with meel or rather broken breed (mola salsa) and

tisanam matris Ducere] The meanings oi the word ‘ducere' are very
rancus. It here means, as it commonly does with ‘pocula' ιο drain.
