Boys wore long hair like girls (⁶ incerta') till they took the ‘toga
virilis? This is therefore the case oi a ‘pupillus' complaining of his

face dignm Arcana] There were no mysteries at Rome analogous
to those ol Greece, at which none but the initiated could be present,
who were bound by oath to keep secret the mysteries l whatever they
werel then mede known to them. As every Greek might be initiated

On the fifth the initiated carried torcbes to the temple of the goddess,
led by a priest called from his office δᾳδοῦχος. This explains ‘face

here. This sense oi ‘indulgere’ ‘to give,' is not, l believe, fo..nd in
the writers before the empire.

selves behind the some walls.
