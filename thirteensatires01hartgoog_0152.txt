SATIRE IV.

Tnn point on which this Satire turns is the degradationes 11ιο sena
tora, some oi whom the poet mentions by name. The sketches 01
character are very good, and are evidently drawn from 1110. The poem
must have been published aiter the death 01 Domitian ,which took
place in the year 96, and aiter the publication 01 11ιο first Satira which
was as late as au. 100.
