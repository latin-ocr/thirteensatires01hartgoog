sarum xiv. 233

212. meliorem praeno magistro] ‘Praesto ' is ‘1 warrant,’ and ‘fore’
may he supplied after ⁴ meliorem! He says to the father he need not
be in a hun-y; he may go away and make himself easy ; his son is
certain to turn out agood scholar and surpass his teacher as far as
Ajax surpassed his father Telamon, and Achilles l'eleus. lle adds
sarcasticatly, ‘⁴ you must not press the young mind; his marrow isnot
yet thoroughly saturated with the atrocities of matured vice; when he
comes to man's estate he will be ripe for all that is wicked.'’ The ex-
pression ‘nondum implevere medullas' is something like that in the
book of Job (xx. ill ι “ His bones are full of the sin of his youth.'’

220. Elaion jam crede aarum] “ Yon may consider your daughter-
in-law as good as dead and buried if. she brings your son a large por·
tion.'’ Except under special agreement before marriage the wife’s
‘dos’ went back to her relations at her death. Here the man must
secure an interest in the property at his wife's death, or it would be
against his interest to mmder her. Notice the plural in ‘vestra'
‘Quibus digitisl' is expressive: ‘with what fingersl' We cau
almost see the man clntching his wife's throatu

22⁵. illaudati} ‘Man-dare'is used heralike ⁴ tradere ' forteaching
(see above, verse 3, n).

228. pueros producit evorea] ‘Producere’is here to educate. The
change of tense from ‘praecepit' should be observed, aa denoting a
course of trainingon aprinciple once laid down. The next lineis
omitted in some MSS, but not in the best. It has no grammatica!
connection with the sentence; either therefore another line hasbeen
lost or this ie the work of an interpolator who forgot to flnish the mis-
chief he had begun. The language in 230, sqq, is taken, as is manifest,
from the ehariot races. ,

23]. queem si revoces] The antecedent to ‘quem ' is easily supplied
by substituting ‘ juveni' for ‘curriculo' The chariat represents the
sod, who is the real subject of the sentence· So immediately below
(verse 241) for an antecedent to ‘quorum’ ‘Thebanos' must be sub-
stituted for ‘ Thebas‚' which is the same thing, aa ‘civitas' is equiva-
lent sometimes to ‘cives’ πόλις to rebrat, and so forth. The change

· of person in⁴revoces’onl makes the sentence more pointed. ‘Nes-

cit’ is used as Horace an others use ‘nescius’ ‘Revoees' is in the

subjunctive of a general condition; A. 59, ὁ, o. ‘Permittas’ is the

subjunctive hy attraction; A. 66, 2. Neither construction is unusual.

234. odeo indalqent sibi latius ipsi] ‘Adeo’ belongs to ‘ indulgent;'
⁴ “so determined are they lo take awider indulgence without asking
your leave ’' (ipsi). With ‘stultum’ in the next verse we must supply
‘esse enm! , -

, 237. et circumscribere] See x. 222. Before‘quantus,’‘tantus’must
be supplied. See note on x. 13. As to the Decii, seeviii.254‚ n.
Menoeceus the son of Creon was said to have sacriflced himself when
Thebes was besieged by the seven chiefs. Teiresias the seer pro-
phesied that if he did so the Thebans would gain the victory. Juvenal
likes a stroke at Greek history (see x. 174) ; he therefore goes out of

v his way, and having spoken οἰ Thebes he adds the legend of Cadmus
