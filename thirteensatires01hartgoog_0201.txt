shipped in that city.

75. εἰ op reesa soret recuro] “ li the old emperor had been caught

⁷7. er qao suffragia aaut] “From the time we lest off selling votes ; ''

that is, since the elections were transferred from the Comitia to the
Senate. See 011 viii. 212. The subjectos ‘effudit curas' is ‘Turba
Remi ' (verse 13). It means they have cast away all care about pub
lic affairs; all they now care for is their belly and the Circus. ‘Panem'
is commonly referred to the public distribution of corn; but I think
that the remark ap lied to all, whether they were oi the sort who
wanted the public oleornot. -
. 81. Perituros audio mattea] One says he hears many are tc share
Sejanus's fate, and another answers there is no doubt of it; there is a
great ,furnace ready (referring to verse 61). Α great many friends of
Sejanus, including his son and his daughter, a young girl, were put to
death soon after him. ¹

83. ad Martissait obuiae aram] This altar of Mars was in the Carn-
pus Martius. There is a Brutidms Niger, whom Tacitus mentions as
aedile in an. 22, and as one of the accusers of Silanus. He may be
the person the speaker refers to as looking a little pale. Under the
character of Ajax, enraged with the leaders and the army for not tak-
ing his part against Ulysses, the man means Tiberius, who in his letter
to the Senats expressed great alarm, and begged them to send ons of
the consuls with a guard to conduct him, a poor solitary old man, tc their
presence. These apprehensions, whether real or pretended the Senate
might well sear would be visited on them, and they hastened to remove
the cause oi them, and everybody connected with him, with an alac-
rity which was to make amends for their implied remissness. This
was what Niger had to fear, and is clearly J uvenal's meaning.

87. Sed adeant πνοή] He says our slaves must see us do it, that
none of them may be able to say vve did not, and give information
under which we shall be dragged with a rope about our necks to the
praetor. In the reign of Tiberius and afterwards the information of
slaves against their masters, which was illegal‚ was freely received
and obtained by torture. Nerva put a stop to the practice, and
checked informers generally. lt was the common way of taking a
resistin culprit before the magistrate to put a rope round his neck.

88. dli sermones] That is to say, wliat precedes. What follows is
addressed to the reader, who is asked if he would like to have all the
power and honor that Sejanus had. The curule officere, or those
entitled tc the nse of the ‘sella curulis,’ were the consuls, censore,
praetors, and curule aediles. ‘Summas’ does not mean the consulship
ln particular ς it applies to all. As tu the nse of ‘ne’ in ⁴ risnel see
on verse 28. 011 ‘illi'·-‘illum,' see Z. 701, note. ,
