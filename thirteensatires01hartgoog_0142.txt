is used 10 express a totally different relation between patron and de-
pendent from what it expressed in the earlier times of the republic.
At this tirhe it did not involve a legal and political distinction, and
meant no more than a humble friend, a dependent who looked to
another for support, counsel, and so forth. ‘Jacturam facere' is to
throw a thing away scas to save the rest. It is an expression bor-
rowed from nautical language. ‘To throw a person overboard' isa
common conversational phrase with us, meaning to get rid 01 him.
On'‘perierunt,' consult A. 58, ὅ, a; H. 471, 1; B. 1095.

126. Quod porro officiata] He here enters upon a subject we have
had before (i. 101). ‘Porro’ means ‘to proceed,' ‘in the next place'
‘Ne nohis blandiar’ is another way of saying ‘to speak the truth'
‘Si' has the sense of ‘even if.’ There were at this time eighteen
praetors in the city. Each praetor had two lictors allowed him. ‘Ire
praecipitem jubeat’ is a common expression of haste. ‘Orbus' was
the legal word for a married person who had no children. The speaker
means to say these rich ladies have long been up waiting for their

· visitors, and the praetor is in a fright lest one of his colleagues should

get to the house before him.

131. Divitis hie serui] ‘Claudere latus' means in effect to give the
wall to a man with whom you are walking. See Horace, S. ii. 5. 17.
The ‘servus’ is now a freedman, and the young gentleman is glad to
wait upon him. ‘Ingenuus’ is one born of free parents. ‘Alter'
means the freedman, and what follows is only a way 01 saying he was
very rich and could indulge himself as he pleased.

132. 0110011101 iu legione tribuni Accipiunt] It does not appear what
the pay 01 a tribune was, but we niay conclude from this passage that
it was not a small sum compared with prices in these times.

135. vestitifacies scorti] She in pursuit 01 her trade would appear
in a showy dress, carried about in a chair (i. 65, nl, 10 invite and
be inspected by customers. Or else she sat in a chair in her house.
and those who came in to admire must pay her well before she would
get down. Το invite her from her sella, whichever it was, would be
the same as to consent to her price.

137. Da testem Romae] He goes on to say honest poor men are not
believed at Rome on their oath. By the host 01 the Idaean divinity,
Cybele, he means P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, who for his great merita
was chosen by the senate to escort the image 01 that goddess, which
was brought from Pessinus to Rome rac. 204. Numa was the most
pious 01 the kings. L. Caecilius Metellus, who triumphed during the
first Punic war, who was twice consul, once magister equitum, dic-
tator, and for twenty-two years Pontifex Maximus, shortly after he
was chosen 10 be Pontifex -rescued the palladium from the temple 01
Vesta when that was on tire. He lost his sight on that occasion. The
