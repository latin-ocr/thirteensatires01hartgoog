and since paper must be spollt, rnercy would be tlrrown away ε Imay
as well spoil it as others.” Suhoolboys will not want to be told what
‘manum ferugae subducere' means ; but it appears the commentatore
are not agree.

16. Consilium dedimus Sullae] The theme on which he professes to
have declaimed belongs to the order called “ suasoriae orationes.’' lt
appears to have been a favorite subject. The advice is, that Sulla
should purchase sleep by laying down his power. He did so, ac. 79,
and died next year in retirement. ‘Suasoriae’ were distinguished
l'rom ‘controversiae,' and belonged rather to boys’ sclrools. On the
case of‘altum,’ seeA. 52, 3,a;H. 371, 1, 3, (2);B. 713.

20. Auruncae flacit ulamma] Suessa, in Campania, the later capital
of tlre Aurunci, whose original town Aurunca (five miles from Suessa)
was destroyed by the Sidicini, was called Suessa Aurunca. It was
the birth-place of Lucilius. ‘Placidi ’ is the nominative plural. '

22. Maeuia Tuscum Figat aprum] This refers to the ‘venationes,’ or
fights with wild beasts at the circus and amphitheatres. The beasts
fought with each other, or with men trained for the purpose and
called ‘bestiarii' of these many were free men and volunteers
fighting for pay, and among them were sometimes found women,
even those of equestrian and senatorial familias, a thing which seems
to have happened first in the year no. 63, in the reign oi Nero.
Domitian forced into the arena not only suen of rank, but women also.
The practice was put down more than a century later by a senatus-
consultum, Λα). 200, in the reign of Sept. Severus. The boare oi
Etruria were particularly large. Tho women aro said to hunt with
their b'reasts bare like tlre Anrazons.

25. Quo tondente] There 'was a barber, Licinus, mentioned by
Horace, of whom tlte Scholiast says that he was made a senator by
C. Julius Caesar. Thereappears to have been some such story con-
nected with a low man of this name, for it passed into a proverb.

26. vernn Canopi Crispiana] Canopus, or Canobus, which gave its
name to one of the branches of tlre Nile, was about fifteen miles from
Alexandria, and a town of dissolute morals, as scaports are wont to
be. It is ior this reason that Juvenal makes his upstart Crispinus a
'native of Canopus. How he commended himself to Domitian, and
rose to be au eques, does not appear. ‘Vama' was a slave born in
his master's house: this man was therefore a ‘libertinus' .

27. Turius nunno reuocante laconas] The ‘lacerna' was a loose
cloak worn over the ‘toga' It was usually of costly dye and ma-
terial, being worn chiefly by the rich. The words describe the way
¹in which the cloak was worn, hitched up on the left shoulder by a
brooch or something of that sort, and floating in the wind, so that the
shordder seems to pull it back. This man appears to have had light
rings for summer, and heavier for winter. That he wore a gold ring
does not prove that he was an eques, ior by the emperors after Tiberius
the privilege was given to the lowest of the people.

30. iniquae Tam patiens Urna] ‘So tolerant of the town's in·

iquities)
