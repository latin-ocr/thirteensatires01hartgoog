170. Ut Gyarichraaaascffalia] Seei. tan. Gyarus and Seriphus
were islanda in the Cycla es group, to which criminals were trans-
ported. Seriphus was the larger ol the two, and about twelve miles
in circunrierence. ’

171. afiyrdia munitam] The city of Babylon is said to have been
built ot brick cemented with asphalt by Semiramis. Here Alexander
died, lac. 323, in his thirty-third year. A ‘sarcophagus' was rop
erly a coffln composed ol a particular stone trom Assos in roas,
which was said to consume the body (σάρκα φαγεῖν).

173. Quantula siat hominum corpuscula] This idea is a favorite one
with the oets. The best-known allusion to it is in Shakespeare's
Henryl .P. i. Act v. Sat:

“ Fare thee well, great heartt
Ill-weaved ambitium how much art thou shrunkt
When that this body did coutain a spirit,
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
But now two paces ot the vilest earth
Is room enough.”

¹ 174. Velificataa Athos] Το avoid the catastrophe that happened to
Mardonius, whose fleat was wreoked there in the first expedition of
Darius against Graece (ac. 492), Xerxes ordered the low isthmus of
the peninsula (Actelto be cut through, aad a'canal was made capable
of floating two triremes abreaat. This wasia rac. lec. Juvenal treats
the matter as an invention; but the canal has been recently traced.
The idiom has been.noticed before. See A& S. 274, 2, R. 53 H.

175. constratam classibus isdem] This refers to the bridge of boats
across the Hellespont, built of the same ships which sailed through
Athos. Herodotus speaks ot' several rivers (tha Scamander in Asia,
and others in Thrace, Thessaly, and Achaia) being dried up by the
enormous host of Xerxes drinking ot them. This is easily explained.
These rivers are not perennial streame full of water. The army could
find water-holca only in many ol them, aad these they may have
exlrsusted. Sostratus seems to have been a poet who wrote ol the
exploits of Xerxes ‘Madidis alis ’ is supposed to mean that he got .
heated with the exertion of reciting his poetry. This is not a satisfac·

wind, as Eurus is the southeast. He flogged whatever wind opposed
him. This may be a playsul invention of J uvenal's, making Xerxes a
harder master to the winds than Aeolus himself, who was stern enough
according to Virgil. Xerxes's castigation and chaining cf the' Hel-
