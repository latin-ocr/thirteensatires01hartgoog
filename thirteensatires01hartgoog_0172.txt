62 satur est quam dicit Horatius, Euoel] The reference is to Hor. C.
ii. 19. t. There is no doubt that Horace wrote all his odes aiter he

64 dominis Cirrhae Nysaeque] Cirrha was situated at the head of the

ground above it was the more ancient city oi Crissa, of which it was
theport. Orissa was the original seat of the worship oi Apollo, efter-
wards transferred to Delphi in its neighborhood ; and in this way Cirrha
cameto be associated with Apollo, who is the ‘dominus Cirrhae ' here
referred to. Nysa is a name given to several places where Bacchus
was worshipped, having originally belonged to that (whererer it was)
which reared him as a child. The locality of the original Nysa is
generally placed hythe poets in the Punjaub. ‘Feruntur‚' ‘are carried
away, borne headlong ;' the word is used for madness or (as here) in·
spiration or other strong excitament. ‘Dominis' seems best taken as

addidit ore;'' and elsewhere from the top of a rock she soundsa
blast upon her horn at which the foresta and rivers are startled,
. mothers press their babes to their bosom, and all the country people
are ronsed to arrns. All this roaring and snakelifting the poet would
not have beon able to inventii he had not been iu easy circumstances,
it he had not had a slave or two and apretty good house. Virgil
had a good dealmore than this. '

having taken part in Piso's conspiracy against Nero. To avoid the
