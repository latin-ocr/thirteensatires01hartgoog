sixty years 01 age, hais experience, as wise a teaeher us philosophy,
taught you no better than to complain because a friend will not give
back a deposit ll-rrls Good men are scarce now} we live in 1 bad
age; yet we call loudly on the 111111 01 gods and 11111123-321. You
must be in your second ehildhood, 10 look 101 honesty now-a-days.
Before gods were 10 plenty, iu the good old times, dishonesty was a
prodigy‚ disrespect was 1 crime. Now honesty is a mighty wonder
(33-111). 10111 tell you 01 those who have lost more than you, aud
they who have stolen the money despise the gods and forswear them·
selvcs lustily (tl-85). Some believe in chance ; others believe in the
gods, but will take punishment 11 they may keep their gains, 01 1111
will run their chauces 01 escaping it ; meanwhile you shout 11 the gods
aud charge them with being useless images (ss-119). Now let an
unleamed man offer you consolation. If there never was so bad a
crime, then mourn as much as .y0u like; but things are everywhere
the same; you have no right to ask 10 be excepted. Go to the prae-
fect's ceurt; spend 11111 days with him ; and then complain 01 your
loss, 11 you dare. No one wonders at the goitre in the Alps, or at bloe
eyes iu Germany, 01 11 battles with the cranes in the land 01 1111 pyg-

1111111120-1131. You say that perjury must be punished. Suppose ·

him putto death; how much will you gaiu by that llll-179) l But,
you say, revenge is pleasauter 1111111111. Chrysippus and Thales and
Socrates would not say so. Philosophy corrects our faults3 only
small minds care 101 revenge, as is evident from the fact that women
love it (rso-192). But do they escape whom conscience lashesl They
suffer. as the Spartan suffered 101 only a wrong desire. The guilty
man finds no rest or comfort 11 meals or in sleep; he is afraid 01
storms and 01 calms, and dreads (11111111111111110101111110-
riflce; 1111111101 any viatim is worth more than his (rsa-235). 'l'he
wicked are changeable; but nature goes back to its own ways. Who
is ever contented with a single crime? He will be caught some day
and 10111110111. You will confess 11 last that noue 01 the gods is
either deal or blind (asa-249 .

1. Exemplo qaodcunque molo One sense 01 ‘exemplum' is a patteru
101 imitation, aad that which is done ‘malo exemplo ' is abad action not
fit 10 be imitated. ‘ Exemplo ' is the ablative 01 quality, as it is called.

2. se Judice nemo nocens absolvitur‚] These words appear to have
become proverbial.

4. Praetoris oi'cerit 1111] In criminal trials 1 praetor usually pre-
sided. Juvenal says that the guilty man is his own judex, and is 1101
aequitted though corrupt influence may win, through the praetor's

lying um; he has a judex within whom no influence cau corrupt. ·

‘Absolve' was the legal word 101 acquittal, represented by a tablet
with A. upon it. Each judex had two others, one marked O. (cen-

demno) and the ether marked N. L. (non liquet) which was an open
verdict. ‘ Vincere' is the technical word 101 winning a cause. See iv.
¹ Mi, where it apphes 10 1 deliberation.
