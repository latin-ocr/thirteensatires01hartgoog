of reverence was the oxyrhynchus (mentioned below on verse 35),
which gave its name toatown between Memphis and Thebes. Ac·
cording to Plutarch, the priests abstained from fish oi every kind.
Small mumruy fish have been found in tombs, according to the
Arabian traveller (of the 12th centuryl Abdallatit', who also found
skeletons oi dogs, which Herodotus says were buried in sacred tombs
in the various cities oi Egypt. Dog mummies have been found, and
. there isa head oi one in the British Museum. Adog’s head was
generally said to be the symbol of Anubis, who was particularly
worshipped at Cynopolis. The Artemis represented by Bubastis may
not have been that goddess who was most commonly worshipped in

“ Graece, and who was the goddess among other things of the chase. It

is probabis Juvenal did not think about Bubastis and Artemis. He
only thought ot his point, that the Egyptians worshipped the beast
and not the bunasse-goddess to whom it belonged. '

9. Parrum et coepe nasos] See below, verse 174. The doctrines of
Pythagoras are supposed to have been in part derived from the

the Theban nome abstained from eating sheep, though they ate goats,
while the opposite practice prevailed at Mendes (in the Delta), where ”
they ate sheep and abstained from goats. The cannibalism imputed
to the Egyptians is fabulous, though Diodorus says that on the occa·
sion of a great famine human liesh was caten (see verse 93, squ).

15. Alcinoa] When Ulysses left the island of Calypso (Ogygia) by
himself on a rait which she taught him to build, he was carried to the
island Scheria, inhabited hy the Phaeacians, whose king was Alcinous.
He was hospitably entertained by the king, and at a banquet told his
adventures. Juvenal says that when Ulysses told wonderful stories
(such as heis going to tell) to Alcinous and his party, though some
took them in with astonishment, a few who had not drunk very deep ·
no doubt treated him as an impostor, and would have handled him
roughly for thinking so meanly ot their understandings. The Greeks
