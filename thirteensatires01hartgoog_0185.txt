in Armenia, which was reduced to a Roman province by Trajan, and
to check the Parthians. The Batavi were a brave people, and were
never strictly tributary to the Romans. lu the years sm. 69, 70, they
carried on a sharp struggle for independence under a native chief
Civilis. 'l'hey were at last put down. The satire, therefore, was
written after this war. ‘Aquilae' is put for the army leit aiter the
outbreak to prevent a recurrence of it.

53. truncoque simillimus Hermae] This seems to have been prover-
bial. ‘Hermae' were busts; properly, but not necessarily, of Hermes ·
or Mercurius, which, like the Greeks, the Romans used to ornament
gaudens, to mark bountlaries, and ior other purposes. ‘Trunco’ only
means that it had no legs. lt ended in a square column.

56. Teucrorum proles] See note on i. 100, ‘ipsos 'l'rojugenab'
‘Sic' is ‘on these conditions,’ and ‘cui' is equivalent to ‘si itti!

63. Hirpini] Lipsius gives an inscription which he says he saw and
copied at Rome, by which it appears that Hirpinus was the son of
Aquilo, a celebrated racer. The stone Lipsius describes was a curicus

one. lt had the figure of a man of the lied faction standing in the Δ

middle, witha stick in his right hand and some hay in tho left, and

· two horses jumping upon him, one on each side ; these are the sire

Aquilo and the son Hirpinus. The inscription on one sidcis Aourco

ie unknown; in iact the roper spelling oi the name is doubtful.

66. trito ditarent epira t'a eollo] They are put to draw with gaHed
neck ‘epiredia’ which were earts or harness, it seems uncertain which.
‘Nepos’ is the name of a baker. There were handmills and mills
turned by horses, or more commonly asses, which is the origin of the
term μὺλος ὀνικὸς, which occurs twice in the New Testament (Matt. ¹
xviii. 6; Luhe xvii. 2). On tha use oi ‘versare' ior ‘qui versantur,'
see A. 65, 2‚f; M. 363, obs. 1; B. 921.

68. primum aliquid do] ‘Da' means ‘tell me! ‘Damus et dedimus,'
‘we give and have always given,' expresses the heartiness with ulrich
such honor is given where it is due.

73. sensus comminus This means a sense held in common with
others. (See Horace, b. i. 3. 66, “communi sensu plane caret.'’) That
sense which is common property would naturally escape the exclu-
sives. It implics a sympathy with mankind which the pride oi birth
in the nature of the case preventa, and also a knowledge ot character
and of the value oi things only to be got through the experience oi
common lite and intercourse with practical minda. In Horace’s in-
stance this common sense is what the French eall ‘tact' The man

of timc and place, and annoying people by want oi consideration.
Here the want oi common sense is shown iu a silly ignorance oi seli,
and oi the worth oi that which all the rest of the world knows is
