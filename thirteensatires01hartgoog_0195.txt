on a plain called Campi Raudii, near Vercellae in Gallia Cisalpina.
Plutarch recorda that there was more credit given to Marius than to
Catulus, though the soldiers of Catulus had done more to get the vic·
tory. lle adds that the soldiers were pre ared tu prevent his triumph,
if Catulus were not allowed to share it. 1hiariushadthe title of third
founder of Rome given him on this occasion.

251. postquam ad Cirabros] This is only a way of saying alter the
battle. The greater part of the army was cut to pisces on the fleld.
It is said that about 120,000fe11and 60,000 were made prisoners; but
probably there is great exaggeration in the numbers'. '

2⁵4. Plebeiae Deciorum animoa] The Decii were, as Juvenal says,
a plebeian family, but a very old one, for at the secession of the plebs,
rac. 494, M. Decius was one oi the deputies sent by them to treat.
with the senate. P. Decius Mus was the first consul of the family,
rac. 380; in that year he commanded the Roman forces, in conjunc-
tion with his colleague, Τ. Manlius Torquatus, in the Latin War. He ·=
devoted himself to death in battle, and thereby secured the victory to
the Romans. His son, who had the same name, acted as his iathar
had done, rac. 295, at the battle of Sentinum against the Gauls. His
son also was consul rac. 279, and commanded in the war against Pyr-
rhus. At the battle of Asculum it was given out that he meant to
devote himself as the others had done3 and to preventa panic in his
own army Pyrrhus gave orders that he should he taken alive.

259. Ancilla natas] This is Servius Tullius; see vii. 199. The
‘trahea’ was a white toga with waving stripes of purple embroidered
on it. It differed from the ‘praetexta' which had only a single bor-
der of purple round the edges. It was supposed to have been worn
by the kings. ‘Diadema' was a band, originally no doubt of plain
materiola which was worn by the kings oi Rome, and is found on
busta of Bacchus. It was afterwards highly ornamented with gold
and preciqus stones. Tullius was succeeded by Tarquinius Superbus,
and so is not called the last king, but the last good king. Tullius is
said to have earned the throne, that is by his bravery and the virtues
he shewed while exercising the power given him by his father-in-law
Tarquinius Priscus during his lifetime.

261. Prodita laxabant] He refers to Titus and Tiberius Junius Bru-
tus, sons of Brutus the first consul, who were in the conspiracy ior
restoring Tarquinius Superbus, and who were scourged and putto
death by the sentence and under the eyes of their own father. The
conspirators met at supper and their conversation was betrayed by
one of the slaves to the consuls. Juvenal says they ought to have
been distinguishing themselves in the strengthening of liberty only '
partially established, and exciting the admiration of such men as Ho-
ratius Oocles (who defended the bridge), Mucius Scaevola (who put
his hand in the dre before King Porsena, having vowed with 300
others to kill him), and Cloelia who, being a prisoner with other
women in Porsena’s camp, swam across the Tiber, and escaped. The
imperfect ‘laxabant' deuotes attempted action. See A.. 58, 3, c; H.
