head, a crown ol gold set with jeuels was carried in the chariot by a
public slave. ‘Servi publici’ were slaves belonging to the stata and
employed ior public purposes, oi which attendance upon magistrates
on official occasions was one. Juvenal says the slave rode in the same
chariat with the consul, oi course (quippe) to lower his ride. Whether
founded on these ironical words or some vulgar error, 'fortunius states
that the slave's business was to wbisper certain words in the ear of the
great man reminding him that he was a mortal. ‘Consul’ is substituted
