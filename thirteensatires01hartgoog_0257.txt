Meduana. —All know, my friend, what kind ot gods Egypt wop
ships; crocodilos, the ibis, apes, ev'en cats, river-fish, and dogs. They
may not eat onions or sheep, but human llesh they may. When
Ulysses told such a story, it seemed more incredible than all his other
tales; but that of which l tell was done publicly not long ago (1-32).
The people oi Ombi worship the crocodile; the people of Tentyra
wage weron them ior this. They surprise them as they are keeping
holiday, and attack them first with abuse, then with fists3 all this is
child's play; then they throw stones such as men can litt in these
degenerata days; what must the gods think ot us (ts-tlt! Part ot
the Ombites fly; the Tentyrites pursne. One of the Ombites falls;
the enemy cut him up and eat him raw, without stopping to profane
fire. They never had a pleasanter mea13 even the blood they serape
up and lick from their fingere (tt-92). In the extremity oi famine,
the Vascones once did a deed like this. We pardonthem. They could
not have bean Stoice then; now Gaul and Britain are learned natione.
But Egypt was more savage than those who offer human sacrifice.
What could have led this people to their crime? No barbarous notiou
ever acted so cruelly as this useless cowardly herd (93-131). Nature
has given men soit hearts and bidden them to weep. We differ from
beasts in having sympathy which leads us to dwell together, to stand
by each other, and to help the fallen. But now snakes and wild beasts
are more harmonions than we ; men are not content to kill, they must
celat eaclp›other. What would Pythagoras say if he should see us

( 2. Crocodilon adorat] Herodotus mentions particularly the people oi
Thebes and those who lived near the lake Moeris as worshippcrs ol
Ἴ the crocodilo, while the people oi the island Elephantine (near Syene)
did not think it sacred, and eren ate the flesh. The town, which after
the time oi Ptolemy Philadelphus bore the name Arsinoe, in ancient
times was called the city oi crocodilos. Herodotus describes the ibis,
aud he says the Egyptians honored it because it destroyed the tlying
snakes that came over from Arabia, and it came to be generally be·
lieved that this bird iod upon snakes. But the ibis is not capable of
eating snakes, aud this is us tabulous as the wingcd snakes themselves.
Itis supposed the Egyptians reverenced this bird because it came to
the country about the time oi the rising of the Nile. It was not a
native of Egypt. There are mummies of the ibis, and it is very
common on Egyptian monuments. Its worship was universal in
Egypt. ‘Adorat' seems to be used comically ot that which is repul·
sive, and ‘pavet' ot that which is harmless.

4. cercopitheci] The cynocephalus or dog-headed ape was sacred to
Thoth, the god of letters, whom the Greeks identified with Hermes.
He was worshipped in particular at Hermopolis in Mlddle Egypt. The
cercopithecus was a long-tailed ape (κέρκος, πίθηκος), and such have
been found embalmed.

5. Dimidio magicae resonant] The most remarkable remains os
Thebes on the western side of the Nile are two seated colossal ligures.
One is covered with ancient inscriptions cut by visitors‚ which show it
