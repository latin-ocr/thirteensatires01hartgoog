time when this satire was written. The cathedral of Tivoh is built on
the inundatione of the temple oi Hercules, who was worshipped above
other gods at Tibur. The enormous buildings erected hy Hadrian at
the foot oi the bills of Tibur could hardly have been built when ‹Juve-
nal wrote these verses, or they would probably have been referred to,
sor in magnificence they surpassed any thing in Italy. Their ruins are
the admiration oi travellers. ,

baths at Baiae. ‘Capitolia nostra ' is here oppoysed to the 'temples at
Praeneste and Tibur; but large temples of ‚Jupiter in other towns,
besides the great temple in Rome, were sometimes called Capitolium.
The plural is used (asin x. bb) because of the tripartite character of
the building (xii. 3, n).

9& Idi-epit epea] This is the common verb in this case. We use the
same when we speak of breaking.

94. turbauit filias amena] See vii. 129, “ Sic Pedo conturbat.” The
use oi ‘dnm ’ with the present followed bya verb in the perfect tense,
which bere occurs twice over, is common. See A. 58, 2, e; Η, 467, 4 ;
and compare i. 69, and elsewhere.

96. nutrientem subbato patrem] He goes on to say that some. men
whose fathers were superstitious and paid respect to the Jewish re·

notro show any one the way except he be aJew, nor to tell the tired

, given for this interpretation of the law of Moses when the dews’ own
traditione and teachers told them they must love their neighbor and
hate their enemy (see St. Matt. v. 43); and Jew and Samariten
thought it strange that our Saviour asked ior water from a Samariten
woman and talked with her. The old law was not of this tenor. “If
tbine enemy be hungry give him breed to eat, and if he be thirsty
