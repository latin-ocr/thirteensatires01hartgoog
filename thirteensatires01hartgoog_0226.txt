89. Hic nostram placabo Jooeml The Penates of a house included one
or more oi the Dii Magni as well as the Lares, the spirits ol their good
ancestors. tupiter, luno, Minerva, and Vesta, one or all, were most
commonly included. ‘Operari ⁹ is commonly used ior offering sacrifice,
or the performance of a religione duty. Here he means his door is
doing its duty with its early morning lamps,

95. Libet exspectare] “I shall be glad to see who will expend a sick
hen, just closing its eyes, on a friend so fruitless as this.'' Cocks οι·
hans were offered to Aesculapius in particular, but also· to the Lares
and other gods. Quails and spurious were types of debauched
passion, and were never very well thought oi. ‘ Cadere’ is a common
word in connection with sacrifices.

98. Sentice calorem] He says if a rich person without children takes
elever, men hang their walls with tablets inscribed with prayers lor
his or her recovery, and vows of sacrifices, or whatever it might be,
ii the prayer should¹ be granted. These tablets were common on all
occasions of this sort or of other important prayers, and they were
hung up in the house of the person praying, or in the temples‚ or on
the statues oi the gods; see 1156. Tablets so inscribed we're also
carried before the victims to the altar. All such vows were made in
public, a principle observed generally in respect to prayer, which was ’
held suspicions il it were secret. It should be noticed as a peculiar ,
construction that the verb in verse 99 is singular though the adjec-
tive ‘orbi’ is plural.

101. exsistunt qai promittant lactantem] ‘Exsistunt qni' cannot
properly be said to stand for‘sunt qui? “Persona start up who

romise a hecatomb (that is a hundred bulls), since elephante are not
lor sale in these parts, and are not bred in Latium or anywhere under
our skies.'' He meam if there were elephants they would have been
vowed instead. ‘Nec venales' is opposed to ‘nec concipitur,' and
‘aut' joina ‘Latio' and ‘usquam' The change to the finite construc-
tion ‘bellua concipitur,' where ‘concepti’ (elephanti) would be ex·

pected‚ is a common Latin usa e (compare xi. 32).
104. sed fiiroa ¹cente petitol ‘Petita' agrees with ‘bellua' and

t ' ‘Caesaris armentum’is in apposition with it. ‘Furva gente'are the

Indians. He says the emperors kept herds oi elephante in 'the country
oi the Rutuli in the neighborhood oi Lavinium in Latium, where
Turnus was king. They were kept for public shows. These beasts are
not prepared to serve any private person, since their ancestors obeyed
the orders of Hannibal (whom he calls Tyrius, as Carthage was a.
Phoenician settlement), and Roman generals, and Pyrrhus, the king
ol Epirus, to which country the Molossi belonged. It was he who
first brought elephante over into Italy, and the battle ol Heraclea
(ao. 280), when it was almost decided against him, he turned with

Livy describes how Hannibal got his elephants over the Rhene. They
