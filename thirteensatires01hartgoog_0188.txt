sarran vm. 169

may herr be rendered ‘besides' See M. 437, b. As to Marius, see
i. 47, n. ‘Discinxerit' is used as we use the word ‘strip'

122 Fortibus et aviaria] It is not well to do any great wrong to
those who are at once brave and poor (miseris), for if you take their
money they will use their arms.

· 125. aon casertanum] He means it is not what we call a saw,a
commonplace. The ‘Sibyllini hbri’ were writings ofaprophetio or =
oracular character, originally os great antiquity. The old books were .
kept in the Capitol, and destroyed with the temple by fire, rao. 83,
- during Sulla’s invasion of Italy. A collection was afterwards made
from various parts oi the Roman dominions of writings professing to
be taken from the Sibyllino books, and this new collection was de-
posited in the same temple when it was rebuilt. These sacred books
were placed by Augustus in the Palatino temple of Apollo. In con·
sultffng th? books a leat appears to have been taken at random, which

xpm St tibi soaclo colors comitum] ‘Cohors' and ‘comites' were
used t‘or the personal staff of a governor. ‘Tribunal vendit’ means
‘sells your judgments.' Itis like ‘suffragia vendimus’ (x. 77). '
‘Acersecomes,' ακερσεκὸμης (with hair unshorn), is Homcr's epithet ior
Apollo, and here means a savorite boy kept for bad purposes.

128. ai nullum in conjoye crimea] In the time of the republic gover-
nors were not allowed to take their wives abroad with thern. Augustus
was very striot about thia. But he himself took Livia with him on
more than one tour. Aherwards the practice became common. We
know homullo Evangelist St. Matthew that Pilate's wile was with
him at Jerusalem.

129. Nec per conventus] Every province was divided into districts,
· in each ol which there was a town where the governor going round
his province stopped and received all Roman citizens oi that district
who came lor justice or other business. These meetings were called
‘conventus’ and so also were the districts. Celaeno was one oi the
harpies‚ and ‘curvis unguibus' represents the Greek γαμψώνυξ. Here
the wit'e is meant.

13]. Tunc liceto Pico] Picus was a son ol Saturnus, and an early
mythical king of Italy. ‘Omnem Titanida pugnam' is the same as
‘omnes Titanas pugnatores ;' the figure is metonomy. They were
sons oi Earth, and Prometheus was one of them. The lorce os
‘ipsum' Prometheus himself, is that he was reputed to have been the
creator oi man. ‘Avus' ‘proavus‚’ ‘abavus’ ‘atavus' ‘tritavus’ is
the ascending scale, but each of these words is used generically ior
ancestors.

1³6. Si ⁸frangis virgas] Soourging was practised only on those who
were not Roman citizens. There wasa Lex Porcia which iorbade any
citizen to be scourged. “Facinus est vincire civem Romanum3 scelus
verberare; prope parricidium necare; quid dicam in crucem tolleret
verbo satis digno tarn nefaria res ap ellari nullo modo potest '' (Cio. in
Verr. ii. add). Of this enormity Terras was guilty. The usual way
ot putting to death was by beheading. The cross was confiued to ·
