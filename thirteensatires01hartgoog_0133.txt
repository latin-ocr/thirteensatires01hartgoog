verse 61. The ‘Via Latina' was tbe oldest road out of Rome, and ran
through the heart of Latium to Beneventum, where the ‘ Via Appia’
joined it. The chief roads leading out of Rome were lined for several
miles with the tornbs of the wealthier citizens, burial within the walls
of the city being forbidden by the twelve tables. Buming was prac-
tised, therefore, as early as the Decemvirate. It grew afterwards
into general use, and was not discontinued till the end of the second
century of the (lhristian era. Heinrich supposes Juvenal, by mention-
rng the ¹Flamrnran and Latin roads, to hint at Domitian and his favor-
1te‚ k'arrs the actor, of whom the former was buried on the Via
Flammas, and the other on the Via Latina.

SATIRE III.

Ture is one of the· best known of Juvenal’s Satires. English
readers are familiar with Jolmson's imitation of it. We do not know
any thing oi Umbricius, unless heis the haruspex of whom Tacitus
says that he wamed Galba of his fate. Neither can wc determine when
the satire was written ; but it cannot well be placed before ao. 110.
Aaouunrvr. - Athis departure for Cumae (1-20), Umbricius relatcs

of thcir guilty secrets (ar-57). Greeks and Syrians oust the native

they supplant the oldest and most faithful clients (tt-125).

And not foreigners alone, but praetore and men of noble blood as
well, thwart the poor client (lat-136). The best of men would not
be believed on their oaths, unless rich. The poor man's shabby dress
makes him abutt; he is ejected from his place in the theatra. He
can never hope to marry an heiress orto receive a legacy (lat-163).
Rent and provisions are high in Rome, and the style of living here is
more pretentious than in the country (rut-189). In Rome there is
constant risk of lires or falling houses; but the rich man does not
care for these things (rao-231). The noise of the crowded streets
makes sleep impossible for the poor (tat-238). The rich man is
borne through the streets in a litter; the poor man is hustled by the
