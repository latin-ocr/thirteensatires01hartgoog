totheiorm‘apium,'see A.11,1.,3,d; M.44,1,a;z.66,t;11.89,
11.,3, 1, 2; Β. 115. The Grammars do not seem to agree as to the
frequency of the form. The word ‘uva' was used by the Romans ior
a cluster of bees, as the Greeks used βότρυς.

71. intercepta dacem quereris] Here then we bave the sum his friend
had lost, about aloc. But suppose 1 tell you (he adds) that another man
has lost twenty times as much in the same way, and a third still more,
so much that abig chest could not hold itt He says the corner of
a chest could hardly hold it; that is, every corner of the chest
was full. ‘Arcana’ is ‘arcanum depositum,’ a trust given in private.
By ‘tam facile' we are to understand that he is putting not a hypo·
thetical, but a real case. On the form of the conditional sentence
(verse 75), see A. te, f, <13 H. 511, 11. ; B. 1271.

76. Aspice quiante Voce neget] ‘Aspice' serves to make the object ·
present, and rtis conventionally uo contradiction to say, See how
loudly he denies it. The man is put before us, and we see him suear-
ing to his lie without changing color or fiinching. ‘Ficti' has some·
thing ofa concessive meaning: “ seigned though it is.''

78. Tarpeiaquefiilmina] The bolts of Jupiter Capitolinus l xii. 6, a).
‘Framea’ wasa German nante for a spear. The ‘venatrix puella'

gar, which was of the strong kind.

86. Sunt in Fortunae qui] Juvenal uses the indicative in ‘ponunt'
because he means a particular class of thinkers, perhaps the Epicure·
ans. See Z. 563;M. 365, obs.1;H.501,2; B. 1228. He goes onto
show how men make up their minds to this wickedness, scine believ-
ing that there are no gods, others that the're are gods, but their anger
is not to be compared with the pleasures of possession, or it will not
come, or at least not yet, and so on. Compare 2 Pet. iii. 4: “All
things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.”

89. altaria coaptant] See above, iii. 144, and xiv. 219. ‘Quaecun-
que ' is not commonly used without averb, like ‘quaevis' Itis so
above, verse 56, and in the following places: iii. 156, twice in iii. 230,
x. 359, xiv. 210. Here it might be taken with ‘tangunt' whatever
altars they touch, but Juvenal's practice makes it probable he meant
the other construction.

He says Isis may strike her angry ‘sistrum ' on his eyes and blind
him, still the temptation is too strong ; be had rather lose his sight
and keep the stolen money than keep his eyes and lose the money.

The Latin name of the ‘sistrum’ is ‘crepitaculutm’ .
