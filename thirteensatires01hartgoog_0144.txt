since they owed it (to themselves) to emigrate.' See Α. 60, 2,c and

1274. He means to say that the poor ought not to have waited at
Rome to be brought to this contemptible condition, but long ago to
have migrated in a body, as he and his family were doing.

164. Haud aciie emergant] “Slow rises worth by poverty de-
prcss'd,” is Jo nson's version, and he wrote from experrence.

166. mugeto hospitium miserabile] ‘Hospitium' is hero put for a
lodging, ‘coenaculum' an upper story room, such as those in which
most poor rnen lived. Even for such a miserable lodging the speaker
says they had to pay a high rent, and they could not do without a
certain number of slaves, whose bellies must be filled, and their frugal

family moal costagood deal. The customary number of slaves in ’

{rivery household had grown enormously even since the days of

orace.

168. Fictilibus coenare pudet] Men are ashamed to dine off earthen·

t ware, though they are not so when they leave Rome and suddenly

, find themselves in the country, with plain fare before thom. This
seems to be the meaning, and ‘negavit' the reading of all the MSS,
will bear intr understood in an· aoristic sense. The Marsi were of

*gabim origin, and all who were so were included under the name

abelli.

170. stenelo duroque curallo] ‘Venetus' is ‘sea-green! ‘Cucullus'
was a hood attached to the ‘lacerna' Ruperti approvcs of ‘culullus,'
a sort of cup, as a substitute for ‘cucullus,' because Umbricius is talk-
ing about dining.

171. si verum admittimus] This is a sort of phrase like ‘ne nobis
blandiar' (verse 126). He says that no one wears the toga in a large
part of Italy till heis dead, when the body of a free person was al-
ways clad in a toga such as accorded with his rank. In the country
towns dress was still very simple; at Rome it was different.

174. tandemque redit ad pulpita] ⁴ Tandem' means after a long inter·
val. It happened rarely; that is, when the annual feast came round
the same old well-known play carne with it. ‘Pulpitum’ (λογεῖον)
was thefront part of the stage, where the actore spoke. ‘Exodia'
were merry interludes, introduced after each of the ‘Atellanae'
whence the name; though it is doubtful whether, as acted in these
rustic theatres‚ the ‘exodium' was strictly of the, nature here de-
scribed.

'¹ 175. personae pallentis hiatum] The masks used in these ‘exodia'
were of a grotesque kind, such as those used by the Greeks in the
satyrio drama. These masks had the mouth wide open, representing
broad laughter or grirming.

178. orchestram et populum] The form of a Roman theatre was
much like the Greek. The seats for the spectators formed a serni-
circle, and rose by steps from the floor ; the semicircular portion oi
which between the scats and the stage was called the orchestra. Here

the chorus performed their part in the Greek theatres; in the Roman
theatro that space was occupied with seats for the magistrates and
