slaves and the lowest malefactore There is a parallel to 140, 141, 111
Wisdom vi. 1,,11 : “A sharpjudgment shall be to them that are in high
·places; for mercy will soon pardon the 1110011001, but mighty men

3halll7be mightily tormented.' With 144, 145, compare Job xxiv.

142. Quo nn'li te] After ‘qu0,’ ‘to what purpose‚' an ellipsis is com-
monly found (see above on verse 9). Here we may understand ‘jactas'
er ‘ostentas' Wills were sometimes executed and kept in the temples.

1408000010] The Santones were a Gallia people north 01 the
Garonne. Their name remains in the town 01 Saintes. They made
woollen manutenturos.

146. Praeter majoram ct'neres] This is explained on i. 171. ‘Carpen-
tum' was a covered carriage on two wheels. Juvenal is speaking 01
the way in which men of family degrade themselves as coachmen
(see 1. 59, n), and says that actually a consul may be seen putting a
big drag on his wheel with his own hands.

147. pinquis haerasia] Lateranus was a cognomen 01 the Claudia
gens, 01 the Sextia, and 01 the Plautia. ‘Testes’ in verse 149, is best
taken as nominative. ·

153. Jam senia] ‘Jam' is only emphatic, like ῆόη. The coachman
is 1101 ashamed tomeet hls friend, t ongh quite an old man, whom
he ought to have blushed to meet. He recognizes him first and
salutes him with his whip, as we see drivers do now, turning up the
butend as they pass an acquaintance. ‘Maniplos’ are the bande 01
hay. He goes through all the dirty work oiagroom. ,

157. Solam Eponam] Plutarch says that Epona was the offsprlng
01 a man and a mare, and that she looked aiter horses; she was the
mule-drivers’ goddess. ‘Iuro’ like ὄμνυμι, is construed with the
accusative. See Hadley's Greek Grammar, 544, a.

158. Sed qaam pervigiles] ‘But when he chooses to visit the cating-
houses‚' which are called ‘pervigiles' because they were kept open all
night 101 the benedt 01 such people. ‘instaurare' is ‘to repeat!
Here it means to visit again and again.

159. Syrophoenix adua amomo] The host always rtms out 10 meet
him with a box 01 ointment such as the luxurious commonly put on
their hair when they sat down to meals. The people 01 Coelesyria
and Phoenice were called Syrophoenicians. They contained among
them remnants 01 the earliest inhabitants. The woman who is called
aSyrophoenician hythe Evangelist St. Mark (vii. 26), is called by
St. Matthewa Canaanite (xv. 22). This Syrophoenician is said to

. be an inhabitant 01 a town 01 Idumaea, which is perhaps here meant
for Judaea. ‘Porta' is used 101 0 place through which traffic passes.
See xi. 1243 cf. iii. 4. Idumaea properly is the equivalent 101 Edam,
and therefore included only the country inhabited by the Edomites,
which was from the southern berder 01 Canaan to Mount Horeb in
Arabia. ln later times Idumaea extended to Hebron on the north.
