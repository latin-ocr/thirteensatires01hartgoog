69. Hic olto Sicyone] ‘These Greeks corne from all parts‚’ he
means. That partos Sicyonia which lay on the coast (of the Sinus
Corinthiacus) was level, and the city ot Sicyon, its capital, was ori·
ginally on the plain, about a mile and a half from the shore. But
this was destroyed by Demetrius Poliorcetes, and a new town was
built by him, which stood on a fortified eminence. Sicyon was celc-
brated for its refinements. Amydon is introduced as being at the
other end oi' Graece, on the banks of the Axius in Macedonia. Others,
he says, are islandcrs, some from Andros, and others from Samos,
the name oi which represented all that was refined and luxurious in
the earlier history of the Asiatic Greeks, but which was itself much
decaycd at this time. Tralles and Alabanda were fiourishing towns
on the main land ; the former in Lydia, on the right bank of the
Maeander; the other in Caria, on the river Marsyas. The last vowel
in “28amo’ is preserved from elision. See M. 502, b; A& S. 305,
1, l.

⁷1. Esquilias dictamque He chooses to represent the city by an im-
portant part of it, including tha third and fifth Regions, which conr- '
prised the Esquiline and Vinrinal hills, and some of the best houscs
in Rome. ‘Esquiliae ' is thought to be derived from ‘excolo' Mons
Viminalis was supposed to have been so called from an osier planta·
tion that grew on the top of it.

72 Viscera] ‘Viscera' and ‘domini' are in apposition with the
subjecta of ‘petunt'

74. Isaeo torrentior] This isaeus was a rhetorician of great emi-

· nance who lived in Juvenal's time.

Ede qaid illum] ‘Come tell ns what you think he is (that is, what is
his particular accomplishment). Why, hc is every thing or any thing
you plesse? By ‘illurn' is plainly meant any ons of these Greeks.
They were ready to open schools for grammar or rhetoric or gcornetry
or drawing or wrestling3 to tell the will of heaven orto dance upon
the tigbt·r0pe; to administer medicines or charms; it was all the
same to thern. It must be remembered that the Grammatici and .
Rhetorici, or toachers os grammar and rhetoric, were mostly foreign·
ers and freedmen: These subjects formed the regular teaching ol' a
Roman boy, till he put on the ‘toga virilis,' and rhetoric he continued
, afterwards. ‘Aliptes' seems to mean ‘a trainer,' the name being
taken from the ‘ceroma’ with which the wrestlers were greased
(verse 68). The Latinior ‘schoenobates' was ‘funambulus’ These
persons were very expert. ¹The professional physicians at Rome
were chiefly Greeks.

76. geometres] This word must be scanned as a trisyllable by syrii·
zesrs.

78. &accolas maneas] ‘The starveling Greek, bid him fly np to
the skies and he 'll do it' (or try). Juvenal adds, ‘In short (if you
doubt mel, it was no other than a Greek, born in the heart ol Athens,
who put on wings and ssew) Daedalus was generally reputed to have .
beenan Athenian. ‘Jusseris' is ‘suppose you bid him! See M.
