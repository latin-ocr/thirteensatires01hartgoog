21. efficiant mobilis at rit] ‘curabilis' is not found elsewhere. It
means that which wauts curing. The way ol speaking, ‘gravior cura-
bilis,’ is Greek; the usual Latin would be ‘gravina' The lengthening
ol the short vowel before the two consonante (22) is not uncommon.

22 Dignum erit erqo] “lt is a proeaeding theu worthyol the rant·
ing ngellius with his stupid hardihood, as long as you have two
round legs, to provoke so many shoes, anch thousands oi hobnails!
This ia explained above ou verse 14. Who Vagellius wasia not
known.

2⁵. Quis tum procul absit] “ Resides this (he asks) who would come
sofar from town, who ia so fust a friend (such a Pylades) that he will

‘Molem aggeris' is referred to m x.96‚ “castra donrestica,'' and
mentioned in v. 153, ‘⁴ in aggere rodit‚” and note, The praetorian camp
ishere referred to. ‘Tam procul’ therefore is ironical, lor the camp
was not abore a quarter oi a mile from either oi the two gates Collina
and Esquilina, northeast of the city. A man must be a Pylades to
take such a walk for a friend, though the Agger which overlooked the
camp was a common promenade. The judex here is the military
officer who heard the complaint .

33. comm pequam possis] ‘Paganus’ alter the tims ol Augustus
came to be applied to all clinans as opposed to military men. It may
have been first given them by soldiers in the way of contempt, for it
belongs properly to tlte country people. ‘Pudorem' is his honor,
which the soldieris supposed to price more thau tho man oi peace.
The word is so used in viii. 83,

36. sacramentum] ‘Sacramentum' was the soldier's oath which
he swore hy the ‘signa' (sanderus), promising fidelity to his coun
and liis commander. The oath was administered on enlistnient. t
is used here for military service, and is put in the plural number like
‘stipendia’ which means ‘campaigus,' that is properly the number ol
times a soldier has earned pay. So ‘sacramenta ' would be the nurn-
ber of times he has taken the oath, which as long as he reniained with
the army would ordinarily be only once, though there were cases in
which it was repeated.

Corneliam ruris aviti] He says if any man robs him of his land,
removes his landmarlr. or denies his dehtahe will have to go through
all tlte law's delays before lie can get justice, which is pronrptly ad-
ministered in campe. ‘Convallis’ is said to be properly a valley sur-
rounded on all sides with hilis, aud ‘vallis’ one between two ranges.
The stone or other boundary by which private property was marked
off was sacred. The landa were in the first instance divided by the
Agrimensores with religious ceremonies, and offerings were annually
made close by them to the god Terminus, whose image was often no
more than a shapeless stone. The neighbors met and offered sacrifice
