gets a bit before it reaches the master. Acoenonetus seems to be a
proper name invented sor this gentleman, who takes as much and gives
as little as he can. The Greek ἀκοινώνητος is exactly copied.

a slice off his see, and beat him down from his price, rather than lose

224 oblilllollanam deducere] ‘Obliquo ferro' is the carding instru-
ment, consisting of crooked bits ol iron sastened in a board. ‘Dedu-
eere’ and ‘trahere’ are usual words t'or this process.

225. olfecisse lacernas] Boys going to school at night carried lanterna

· with them ; the master had to bear the smell ol as many lamps a's
there were boys, aud their books were black with the smoke. The
works oi Horace came to be a class-book, as he soretold they would 3
Virgil's were thus used before his death.

228. quae cognitione tribuni] What authority for the administration

233. Phoebi belom] ‘Balnea' were bathing-rooms or houses;

‘thermae' large buildings intended ior gymnastic exercises, and also

supplied with hot water and vapor baths. Thc historical questions
these poor teachers are to answer are not unparelleled in some modern
examinatione. The Scholiast thought he knew the name oi Anchises’s

his son the Nemean Gamet were instituted. But Virgil speaks of

another. He was son ol an Italian prince Rboetus, who married a

second wife named Casperia, and her step-son is said to have com·
