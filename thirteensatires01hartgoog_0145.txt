foreign ambassadors. ‘Clari velamen honoris: the dress of a noble
magistrate, is meant in a jocular way; ior if the aediles at Rome
were reduced so low, those of the country towns were small enough.
But they were great in their own little sphere. Yet all alike wore
tunics.

184. Quid dra] ‘What sums do you give the servants that you may
have the privilege of attending sometimes the “ salutatio ” of Cossus 3 ’
ghich ινεὲε the cognomen ol a branch ol the Cornelia gens. Compare

orace at. i. 9. 56.

18ss Ut re respiciat] Fabricius Veiento was sent into banishment in
the reign of Nero, but returned in Domitian's, and distinguished him-
}elf as anNinformer and a flatterer of the emperor. He also had the
avor ol srva. '

186. Ille merit barban] When a youth first shaved it was a holi-
day, and the young down was sometimes offered to some god, with
the long hair, worn in boyhood, but cut off when the ‘toga virilis',
was put on. This ceremony was observed by certain masters with
their favorite slaves. Umbricius supposes such a case, and says the
house was immediately full of cakes offered to the slave, as if he ¹
were a son oi the family. ‘Libis venahbus' means, as Britannicus
says, cakes which the slave would sell to make money by, which
money would go to increase his ‘peculium’

18⁷. Accipe et istud Fermentuff ‘'l'akc this home to stir your bile!
The words are addressed by mbricius to his friend; ‘istud' being
the fact that follows, of which what goes before is an illustration. The
‘peculium ' of a slave was the property he was able to acquire for him·
sels by such means as his master might allow, and which would arise
in various ways, direct and indirect. It was virtually his own, but
strictly no slave could hold property. Slaves often accumulated large
sums, purchased their freedom, and made themselves confortabis for
lile. -
190. gelida Praeneste ruinam] Praeneste (Palestrina) was twenty·
three miles east of Rome, on the edge of the Apennines. Virgil and
Horace, and all other writers, use Praeneste in the neuter gender ; hut
in Aen. viii. 361 Virgil has “Praeneste sub ipsa,'' where, as here, it is
feminine. Gabii is repeatedly mentioned by Horace as a deserted
town. It lay on the Via Praenestina, midway between Rome aud
Praeneste. Juvenal here calls it ‘simplices' ‘urrsoplristicated5' but
this was compared with Rome. Volsinii, which retains its name

’ under the form of Bolsena, was an important city of Etruria, situated

at the foot of the hills above the lake that was called after it. lt stood
on the Via Cassia, seventy·two miles from Rome. Tibur (Tivoli),
which was sixteen miles from Rome, on tho banks of the Anio, is
here called ‘ pronum,' and by Horace ‘supinum’ because it was situ-
ated on the slope of a hill. ‘Arx' was commonly used for a town so
built, though the citadel was gone or had never existed, orior a hill
on which no town was built at all.

193. tenui tibicine sultam] ‘Tibicen’ is a buttress. Festus says it is '
so called because it supports houses as the fluteplayer sustains the
singer, which Porcellini quotes, or it would not be worth noticing.
