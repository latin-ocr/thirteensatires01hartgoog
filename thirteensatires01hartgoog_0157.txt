81. Crispi jocundo senectus] ‘Cheerful old Crispus' Vibius Crispus
was an orator often mentioned by Quintilian, who speaks of him in
terma like Juvenal, as “vir ingenii jucundi et elegantis.'’ He was
worth nearly totototo. On ‘liceret' see A. 119, 3, c; M. 341, obs. 2 ;
Α. c S. 261, R. b. ‘Vero’ is the 0111001001111100010100000.
‘Quoque’ here and in verse 115 seems to mean ‘even'

101. ortas Patriciae 1] The various arts to which the Patricians had
recourse to save themselves. Glabrio's was that 01 degrading himself ,
into a‘venator,' which Juvenal compares with the craftiness of L.
J unius Brutus, who, Livy says, allowed himself to be supposed a sool,
that he might the better watch 101 his opportunity 01 delivering his
country. This trick might pass with Tarquinius Superbus, a king 01

modern tyrants. ‘Barbato regi’ is like Horace’s ‘intonsi Catonis'
