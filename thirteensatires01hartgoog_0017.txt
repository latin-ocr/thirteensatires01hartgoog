of J uvenal's personal character it is not very easy to
forman estimate from his writings. That his invectivas
against the vices of his time are not the mere artistic
and declamatory compositions which some writers suppose
them to be, but the fruits of an honest indignationes rare Ι
powers of caracam, and of a large knowledge of the world,
I think is manifest. His language is unreserved in dealing
with the foulest vices, but there is no appearance of his
being himselfa loose liver in any part of his writings.
When Horace is coarse, he betrays something of sympathy
with vioe, while Juvenal shows only contempt for it.
Although therefore an expurgated edition of Juvenal Ι

Horace, a well-regulated mind would be less offended
with the entire text of Juvenal than with that of Horace.
J uvenal's morality was of a higher and less technieal sort
than Horace’s, and has led sorno into the notion that he
drew it from the purest source, and was in understanding‚
’ if not by profession, a Christian. This of course is absurd.
He knew human nature, and he knew right from wrong,
and was not blinded by seli-indulgence, and so was able
to state the law of conscience in away to astonish some ,
’ (Christiana to whom that law is very imperfectly known. > ¹

words, and had a large fund of illustration. His pietures.

the notes, are particularly happy3 whether they represent
the common room of a tavern, or the deck of a ship, or
the inside of a soldiefs hut or of a camp, ora school-roem,
or the greedy crowd at the sportula, or the streets of
Rome, or a drunken brawl,* these and a hundred other
soenes are so drawn that an artist would have no difficulty
