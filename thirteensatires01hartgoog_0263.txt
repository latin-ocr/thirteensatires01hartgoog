93. Vascones, liecsama est] The territory oi the Vascones lay where
now is the province oi Navarre. Alter the murder oi Sertorius, nc.
72, many of the towns in Hispania which had taken part with him
against On. Pompeius and Q.Metellus ·1'ius held cut, and were besieged
hy those commandere or their legati. Among the rest was Calagurris·
Nassica, a town on the right bank ot' the Iberus. After having been
unsuccessiully besieged during the lite oi Sertorius, it was attached
again aiter his death ·hy 1.. Afranius, the legatus oi Pompeius. The
inhabitante of this city resisted the siege to such extremities that they
were reduced to sating each other. This obstinate resistancc seems
to have medea great impression'on the Romans.

94 cedrea diversa, sed illic] Juvenal says in the case oi the Vascones
the circumstances were different; it was the malicc oi Fortuna and the
extremities oi war that·drove them to this horrid act. ‘Bellorum
ultima' is like ‘¹ discriminis ultima'' ( xii. 55). The Greeks commonly
used ἔσχατα in the sarna way.

9⁷. Huy'us enim uod iruna agitur] “ The case is different, ior this sort
ci iood oi which ἵ am now speaking (that to which men arc reduced

mentioned,'' etc. ‘Hujus exemplum cibi' stands where we should
expect ‘hoc exemplum! ‘Exemplum' is the antecedentes ‘quod'
He had heard less ci the siege oi Jerusalem or he might have iound
plenty oi like horrore there. ln the place where he wrote the same
soenes were enacted three centuries later. See Gibbon's account oi
the first siege cf Rome by the Goths (c. 31).

107. Ze conis praecepta monent ,·] Juvenal says (xiii. 121) that he has
never read the doctrines oi the Stoice and others. But he rightly
represents them here. The sacrifice oi lite to duty was a rulo they
always taught, and they professed no such loto ci liie or isar oi
death as would lead to the neglect oi the first principles oi natural
affection. But it does not iollow that they might not have advised thc
holding oi atown at any eost against an enemy with the chivalrous ,
motive attributed to the people oi Calagurris. ‘Nec enim’ is equiva-
lsnt to ‘etsi enim non! He calls them Cantabri without strict accus

Metellus, see note on verse 93. He calls him ‘antiqunsss because
every thing was antiquated that was before thetime oi the empire.

110. Nunc tatus Graios] He says it is different now,for all the world
has the literature and philosophy oi Greece and Rome. Re calls
Rome ‘our Athens! Their spirit and their institutione were their
own; their teste and philosophy the Romans got from Graece, and
