sarran v. Ι 141

Juvenai's conclusion is, that they who will put up with such treatment
deserve it; and the rich man is not much to blame if he despises those
who are only drawn to his table by the nose, that is, by the savor oi
his kitchen. ⁴
The satire has its moral for modern society, in which, if the relation
of host and guest is prevented by good breeding from taking the form
here represented, eating and servility are scarcely less prominent
features than they were at Rome in its worst days. ‘If the rich look ·
down upon the poor, it is usually because ol the homage rank and
riches meet with ; and that this homage comes of selfishness none
· know⁸better than those who receive it. The coveting ot* what is called

. good society is the vice of a rotten system; and theman who seeks

company which does not want him has no reason to complain if his
, pride is galled and his expectatione are disappointed. It there were
no Trebiuses in the world there would be no Virros; so Juvenal
tgoughm and he does well to iay the chief weight of his satire upon
teparasite. ·

The parasite, or dines-out, of later times, had no resemblance to the
client of the republic. He was no inore than one of many in the train
of a rich man, o‘r of as many rich men as he could get attached to in
that mean capacity. The old relation of ‘patronus' and ‘cliens' so
far as we can understand it, was simple and natural. The other was ·
the mere refuge of poverty, preferring the bread of idleness and a
false tangue to a life of honest labor and the rewards of an indepen-
dent mind. The student will only be misled if, following some of the
commentatore, he looks upon the latter condition as but another
phase of the former. The old institution died out with the republic
to which it belonged; the modern practice was the fruit of human
corruption, and has its analogies in all ages of society, such as is
called civiiized.

Aneunrrnr. -Men of honor, Trebius, would choose beggary rather
than such dependente as yours il-ll). For, first, when Virro invites Ἴ
. you to his heard, he thinks that he hasrepaid you forali your services
(ia-23). Then, at dinner, you are served with poor wine which incites
you to quarrelling; he has the very best (24-37). Virro's cups are
¹jewelled; you are hardly trusted with any thing but giass; andyou do
noteven drink the same water (et-53). You are waited on by aMoerish
runner; he, by a fair youth of Ionia (53-66). You ‘must gnaw mouldy
bread, and not presume to touch Virro's loaf. This is all your reward
(er-79). Virro's flsh are the choicest, yours the poorest (80-106).
Virro’s unsocial arrogance, too, is worthy of a passing rebukc (107-

ν 113). While dainties are carved for the host, you must look quietly

on (lit-lssli. You would he differently treated if you were wealthy
· and childless (rat—145). The mushrooms and fruits offered to you
differ from those which he has (rto-155). He does all this on purpose ¹
to mortify you; and you deserve to be treated like a slave, for such

you have made yourself (lte-173). .
