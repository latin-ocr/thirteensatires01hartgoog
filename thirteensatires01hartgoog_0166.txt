tolay waste his native place, is told by Homer (Il. ira). Virro's boar ¹
was a worthy companion for this monster. A boar served up whole
was commonly the cbiet' dish (‘caput coenae ¹). The fattening oi
fowls (altiles) and the livers of gecse was carried to perfectiori by
these Romans. The geese were lattened on figs. Jn our day Stras·
bourg has been famous for its peiles cle fhies prae, some of the livera

116. tradentur tritam] ‘Tubera’ were great delicacies with the Ro-
mans. Whether they were what we know as the ‘tuber cibarium' or
common truflie, has been doubted. They cannot have been very dif-
ferent. They were said to be produced by autumnrains aud frequent
thuader; so the author calls the latter ‘optata' From this notion the
‘tuber' was called ‘ceraunium' The epicure Allidius is willing that
Libya, the greatest granary os Rome, should give up sending corn
aud furnish only truffles. He is introduced in a parenthesis. On the
subjunctive ‘mittas' consult A. 61, 3; H. 503,1.; M. 351, b, obs. 2.

120. Structorem] This is the title of theman whose business it
was to arrange (struere) the table. Itis also used for the person who
carved the meat, otherwise called ‘scissor’ or ‘emptor' The latter is

with various fantastic movements of the arms and legs, flourishing
their knife about, as here described. These persons were trained

χειρονομὲω, to throw the arms in time. ‘Dictata’ arethe lessons, and
‘dictare' is to teach; because it was usual sor the master to read
aloud to his scholare that which they had to leern and repeat.

ἯἸΙΘέΊἪὲοενε, tanquam habeas] ‘If you ever attempt to open your

' mouth, as if you were a man of family and had three names.' Ro

man citizens had generally three names: ‘praenomen' which was
given on the ninth day after their birth ; ‘gentilicium nomen‚’ which
indicated the Gens to which they belonged; and ‘cognomen' which
was the family name belonging to their branch ot‘ the Gens. To these
was sometimes added an honorary name, called ‘agnomen’ derived
from some great action, or other cause, as ‘Publius Cornelius Scipio
Africanus' A slave had only one name, and a freedman toolr usually
the ‘praenomen' end ‘nomen gentilicium' of his late master, but not
his ‘ cognomen,' instead of which he sometimes retained his own name
