SATIRE XVL

Is seems impossible ιο avoid the conclusion thet this is an uniiunhed
poem, and it may well have been a posthumous publication. It has
been doubted whether Juvenal ever wrote it; but no imitator who
evidently could do well, would have been willing to lesve the poem in
the condition in which we find it. There does not seem ιο be suffi-
cient reason for supposing the fragment ιο be spurious orior thinking
thst the partiti reiection cf itin earl times proceeded irom‘any other ,
cause than its impert'eot character. it is in the form of an epistle, aud '

professes to set forth the advantage· of military service, locking at it
us ayoung man might when tired of the restraints of a civilian’s j

vice? First, no civilian dares assault you; sud, if you beat him, he
dares not bring you before the praetor. He must refer his case to the
centurion ; and his revenge will beharder forhim than the wrong; wit
nesses will not dare to testify on his side (1-34). li a civilian has a
trouble with his neighbor, he has to wait for all the delays of the law ς
the soldier gets justice done him at once (aeto). Again, all that the
soldier earns is his own; his iether has no control over it. The father
will court the successful son. For it is for the general’s interest that
the breve should be lucky and rewarded (tl-60).

1. Quis nutnemre preat] The writer aske, “ Who ean number the ad-
vantages of military service is it bc successful? As ior that, inl can
'oin a fortunate legion, let me enlist and I shall count myseli lucky.''

think oi nothing more delightiul. He is speaking sarcastically. Some
of the more distinguished legions bore names of honor, such ss Victrix,
'Felix, Adiutrix, end so forth. This is what he means by ‘prospera
castra) A soldier was a ‘tiro’ till he had seen service and was ac
quainted with his duties. ‘Pavidum’ is here only a redundant
eithet.

p4. fati valet lora leniam] This is Juvenal's ironical style; having

mentioned a lucky star, he adds, “ for ol course the moment of a smil·

ing fate is of more avail than a letter of recommendation ιο Mars irom

his wiie (or mistress) Venus or his mother Jun0.'’ Juno's worship at

Sarnos is weh known. Her temple, the Heraeum, was on the coast,
¹ itis ιο the Samian shore that ‘mena' refers.
