47. ethic damnatus inani dedicio] We have 1110 private thief and the
public brought together. Marius Priscus, proconsul 01 Africa, was
convicted (10100101 ‘ repeturrdae,' end banishcd from Italy. Marius
ivae compelled to refund a part of 1111 bad gains, and retired with the
remainder to live comfortably, though not at horne. The offense 01
‘repetundae,' which was that of a magistrate getting money by illegal
means from the provinciale under 1111 government, was punished with
different penalties at different times. The latest ‘ lex' on the subject
was the ‘lex Julia' passed in the dictatorship of dimissoriam,
which abolished the punishment 01011110 ; but it appears to have been
revived under the empire. The refunding of the money proved to
have been received was always part of the penalty; and in this in·
1111101 11 appears that 700 sestertia (about aulaeo) were paid by
Marius into the treasury. ‘Ab octava bibit' means that he sat down
to dinner earlier than usual; the ninth hour in summer, and the tenth
in winter, being those at which industrious persons generally dined.
‘Fruitur dis iratis,’ he enjoys the anger of the gods 3 that is, he makes
himself comfortable under his punishment. For the idiom, see A. 72,
3,o; H. 580, B. 13573 A. 11 S. 274, R. 5. ‘Vincere’ is the legal
word 101 succeeding in a cause.

51„ Venusina digno 1110111101] Horace was born at Venusia, on the
Appian Way, between Beneventum and Tarentum„a.c. 65. lle
seems 10 have been looked upon by Persius and Juvenal as the repre-
sentative 01 Roman satire. Lucilius was more in Juvenal's way, and
he mentions him below with respect. ‘Lucerna' only means what
we mean when we speak 01 the ‘midnight oil.'

52. Sed qvid inopis Heracleas] ‘Agitant’ must be repeated, but in a
different sense. ‘Fabulae' is the noun to be supplied, 11 any is
needed. He aske why he should rather write ou such hackneyed
subjecta as the labors of Hercules, the wanderings of Diomed, the ad· ι
ventures 01 Theseus, icarus, and Daedalus, than attack the vices of
the day? ‘Puero' may be the ablativa 01 “dead weight,'' as Mayor
calls it, 01 the dative. See references on verse 13. ‘Mugitum' refers
01 course 10 the Minotaur.

5⁵. Quum leno occipiat moechi bono] This mun connives at his wife’s
intrigues at his own table, und gets her paramour to make him his
‘heres,' which the woman could 1101 be, if the man's census exceeded
locabo asses. He fixes 1111 eyes on the ceiling, as if wrapped in
thought, 01 pretends to snore over his wine.

58. Quum fos esse putet] “ When that man thinks he has a right to
look for a tribunc’s place, who, while yet a boy, wasfed his substance
on his stabias, and lost his patrimony with flying on swift coach down
the Flaminian road3 101 he was Automedon and held the reins while
the great man made himself pleasant 10 his man-mistress.'' This per-
1011 may have been some favorite 01 Ι)0111111011’1, who had been made,
or hoped 10 be made, a ‘tribunus militum' The Flaminiam road led
north from Rome to Ariminum. ‘lpse’ 11 often used independently

for ‘the great mam' and is here opposed to Automedon, as Achilles to
