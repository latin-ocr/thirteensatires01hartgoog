probably), as ‘quippe’ from ‘quia' and they mean ‘surely,' ‘oi
course! ·Μ. 435, obs. 4; Z. 278.

168. Thermarum calices] ‘Thermae’ here is the same as ‘thermo-
polium.' Hot wine and water was a favorite drink with the Romans,
and it was sold at these ‘pophrae,' where theiood and drink were
cons'umed on the premises, not supplied to be taken home, as
from ‘cauponae’ ‘Iuscnpta lintea’ has been variously explained.

people were carried out to burial. The Galli and their drums are
well known This priest is lying druuk on his back with his drum
by his side. The vulgar group and their famuliarity are well repre·
