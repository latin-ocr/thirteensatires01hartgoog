the marshes in the neighborhood were famous for wild boars. Cor-
vinus was a cognomen of the Messalae, who were a branch of tho
Valeria Gens, one of the oldest familias in Rome. This gentleman of
old family is supposed to be reduced to keeping sheep as a ‘merce
narius! A person is said ‘conducere rem faciendam,' in which case he
receives pay (‘merces'), or ‘conducere rem utendam,’ in which case
he pays another for the thing used.

108. epo possideo plus] That ‘ ossidere' was used generally in the
sense of possessing property, and not condned to the ‘possessores'
technically so called, is obvious from this and many passages. The
‘possessores' of the republican period were occupiers of public lands;
and this man could not bea ‘possessor' in that sense any more than

· ·Pallasor Licinus. He makes himself out tohevastly rich, and yet

he is here begging.

109. Pallante el Licinia] The man’s speech ends here. Pallas was
a freedman of Claudius, in whose reign he got together a large for-
tune, for the salte of which he was put to death by Nero, sm. 63.
Licinus was a Gaulish slave manumitted by C. Julius Caesar, and
made by Augustus governor of Gallia, which he rabbad, and thereby
grew very rich. The plural in ‘Licinis' is put, by a common usage,
for the singular. The grammar-s fail to notice it.

110. sacro nec cedat honori] The person of the ‘tribunus plebis’ was
inviolable, ‘sacrosanctus'

111 pedihus qai veawot albis,·] Slaves newly imparted are said to
have been challred on the soles of their feet when exposed for sale;
hut what could hare been the use of challring their soles is not
obvious.

114. templo] The intransitive use of the verb ‘habito' is more com-
mon than the transitive. The temple of Pax was one of the hand·
somest buildings in Rome, and was situated on the Via Sacra. It
was begun by Claudius and finished by Vespasian, who depositcd in
it the spoils of Jerusalem brought to Rome by Titus. It was bumt
down in the reign of Commodus, about 120 years after it was built.
Fides had a t'emple on Mons Capitolinus, which was said to have
been founded originally by Numa, and was afterwards restored in
the consulship of M. Aemilius Scaurus, rao. 115. No less than three
temples of Victoria are mentioned, one of which was in the forum,
another on Mons Palatinus, and athird on Mons Aventinus. In his ¹
first consulship M. Marcellus built a temple to Virtus near the Porta
Capena, from which the Via Appia began. ,

116. crepitat Concordia nido] “ Concordia, who twitters when the
birds salute their nest; '’ that rs, her templa sounds with the twittering
of'the birds. Mayor translates: ‘⁴ who clatters when she visits her
nest.’' The birds and the goddess, he says, are identified. There
was a beautiful temple to Concordia in the Carinae, originally built
by Furius Camillus after the expulsion of the Gauls, rao. 391101
restored by Livia, Augustus's wife. There was another that stood
between the Capitol and the Forum, in which the senate sometimes
held its meetings. Some say that the orow, others that the -stork,

aa the bird sacred to Concordia.
