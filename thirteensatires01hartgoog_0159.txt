SATIRE V.

Tms satire professes to be addressed to one Trebius, the representa·
tive of a class of men, who, being poor and exquisitely servile, were
willing to part with their independence and put up with all sorts of
contemptuous' treatment for the sake of a dinner at the tables of the
rich. A specimen of such a dinner is given, at which Virro, the host,
reserves for himself and his rich friends the best of every thing, meat
and fruit and wine, aad the parasites are sulkily served withthe worst,
by slaves too fine to make up to the guests for the master's neglect.
