57. Dimidios, alios socies] Aa to ‘dimidios' see above, verse t. It
does not only mean ‘broken off! There is ‘ dimidium crus ' (xiii. 95)
101 0 broken leg. ‘Alias facies ’ is ‘altered faces! On ‘aspiceres'
see A. 60, 2, 0; M. 366, 37ος H. 486, 111.,4; Β, 1278. ‘Calcent’
shows that 1111010 the reason which they would have given. ,

61„ Et sone qao intrimentis] “The people think this is only child’s
play, and they are right, 101 what is the use 01 such thousands 01
fightersif 11011001 1110111010111110111” There is humorin 11110. ‘Quo'
is used as several times before. See references 011 viii. 9. ‘Millia’ is
accusative; we may supply ‘habent' 01 ‘parant' ‘Saxa inclinatis
per humum quaesita lacertis ' expresses the way in which they stoop
ao piok up the 0101100 while they keep an eye upon the enemy all the
time. Stones he says are the usual weapons 101 squabbles where
townspeople fall out among themselves. ‘Domestica' means such as
they were familiar with. Virgil tells us ho'w Turnus threw a huge rock
at Aeneas. Homer says that Ajax threw a great stone at Hector, and
Diomed, as Juvenal says, hit Aeneas on the hip with a stone that a
couple 01 men 01 unheroic days could 1101 1111. Homer lived probably
not many generations after the Trojan war. The race 01 giants was
growing less even in his day (¹ vivo jam Homero ’1. But the strong¹

men before Troy were nothing to those Nestor knew in his youth, and κ

soit goes on. The past is seen through a mist, and all things gone
must 1100110 be greater and better than the present. But men and things
are much what they have been and always will 110. 110 says men of
this day are both wicked and foeble; so the gods, or whichever 01 1110
gods takes the trouble to look at men, both laugh at them 111111 hate
them. ‘Quicunque aspexit' is contemptuous and Epicurean. The ·
difference in tense in ‘percussit' and ‘valeant' explains 110011; the
former is indicative because 11 declares a fact, the 10110110 subjunctive
because it belongs to a description. See A. 66, 2; Μ. 364, 0110. 1.

72. A dioerttialo repetatursobalo.] “After this digression we may go
back to our story.'’ He might have ex ressed this more shortly by
‘sed' (verse 33, 61) or‘ergo' (x. 64). ‘ 010011010’101110 Tentyrites,
who witha reinforcement put the Ombites to flight. 110-11110010
110111 this place that by Tentyra there was a grove 01 palme, noun·
common thing ς but 11110 grove was perhaps an uncommon 0110. ‘ Hmc ’
10 ‘on this side ς’ that is, among the fugitives, as the context shows.

82. Aut amabam] We must supply ‘torruit' which is'implied by
zeugma in ‘decoxit ‘Usque adeo' belongs to both adjectives, ‘so
very tedicus and elna?

84. Hic paridem libet] “ Here we may rejoice that they did 1101 dese·
crate that 1110 which Prometheus stole from heaven and gave to earth.
Icongratulate the clement 011 110 escape, and 1 dare say you rejoice
too.'' 110 10 addressing his friend. This element has 110111 1110 earliest
times been respected as a beneficia] agent and as the symbol of the
divine attributes and 01 1110 life 01 man. The Persians worshipped it.
and their descendants the Parsees do so still. But Juvenal is only
writing sarcastically.

87. Sed qai mordere cadaver] ‘Sed' is, as before, a way 01 carrying
ona subject aller a digression. As to ‘sustinuit’ see xiv. 127, n.
