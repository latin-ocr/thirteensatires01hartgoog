agit' has this meaning commonly. The rich man treats his poor
guest in thia scurvy iashion, not to spare expense, but to enjoy the
sun oi seeing him grintling his tecth and weeping with vexation. And

or other (quandoque) come to this. The last few verses of this Satira
are a good specimen of contemptuous writing well deserved.
