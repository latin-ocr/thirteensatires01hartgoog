32. Quanto Faesidium laudat] Faesidius is a ‘causidicus' but a man
of substance, who has clients that corne into court and applaud him
loudly. ‘Sportula' means the cliente who get the ‘sportula' (i. 95,
nl. The omission ol ‘muto' before ‘quanto' is common (see x.
13). Pliny describes with a good deal oi disgust how young men with
no qualifications· thrust themselves inlto ίῑίΙιθ inierffl congr? anddadds
llll ht intelligentitibus tristuiil‘ssuttl lli}
collect in the middle oi the basihca, where the ‘sportula’ rs served out
to thern as openly as in the diniug-room: these fellows go about from
court to court ior the same pay (the ‘sportula'), from which they
have got the name σοφοκλεῑς (because they cried σοφῶς, as we say
¹ bravo ') or in Latin ‘leudicam' .

33. senior bulla dignissima} He means he must be in his second child·
hood. The Greeks said, ὁὶς naida ol γέροντες. ‘Bulla' is explained
on v. 164. In verse 36, ‘ut' is easily supplied belore ‘putet' For
the use of ‘quoquam' see on x. 184. The altar is red with the blood
oi the victim.

40. Saturnus sapione] Thetis, before Saturnus was driven from
Olympus by Jupiter and took to the reapinghook in Latium, where
he taught the natives agriculture and became king of the country. He
is usually represented witha reaping-hook in his hand. The Greek
legende varied as to the place where' Zeus was brought up when his
mother Rhea hid him irorn his father Cronus. The common story

’ was that she took him to Crete, where he was educated. Ida was a
mountain mass oi considerable height in Crete. See xiv. 271, n.

⁰42. Nulla super naba] These feasts of the gods belong, he means,
to a later age than that of Saturnus, to the age oi heroes, which He-
siod places the fourth in his list. ‘Puer Iliacus’ is Ganymedes. He
is represented as the son of Tros, or of llus theson oi Tros. Either
way Troas was his native country. and he was carried off, according
to the common account, from the Trojau lda. He is said to have suc
ceeded Hebe as cup-bearer of the gods. · She was a daughter of Jupi-
ter and J uno, and became the wiie of Hercules. ‘Ad cyathos' is the
ordinary way ο( expressing this office.

44. etjam siccato stature] ‘ nt’ sometimes follows ‘ nec’ to carry on
the negation. See Krueger, Lat. Grammatik, 533, Anm. 4, a, 3. J uve
nal groups Hebe aud Vulcan together, and they make a picturasque
contrast. He comes in reeking from his work. She is at her task on
Olympus, and hands him a cup to reiresh him, which he first drains
and then wipes off the sweat lrom his black arms. All this Juvenal
says was aiter the simple days of Saturnus.

46. Prandebat sibi qrsisque dena] ‘Each god dined by himself) He
says ‘prandebat’ because the ‘prandium' (which we call luncheon)
was a plain meal. The dative seems to be that “ of advantage.” See
A. 51, l, and note. Juvenal is ridiculing the polytheism oi the poets
and the gigantic system ol vice sanctioned by divine example.

47. Talis ut est lodie] ‘Talis' is equivalent to ‘tanta' This use ol the

word is less common where only quantity and not quality is expressed.
