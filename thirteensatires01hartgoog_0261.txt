the river than Tentyra, which was nearly opposite to Coptos on the
west side. Thebes lay between them. ln Ombi the crocodile was svor·
shipped; in Tentyra they killed and ate it, and so the people iell out.
Plutarch tells us that in his day the Oxyrhynchites, who held sacred
a fish with aeharp snout, and got their name irom it, went to war with
the Oynopolites, the dog-worshippers, because these ate the fish, and
the others by way of retaliation ate dogs. The MSS. vary in respect
to Ombos. The distance between the two places is the stumbling·
block, because Juvenal calls them ‘finitimi' This will not decide the
question, and the reading oi the text is probably right.

37. Odit aterque inaug] A true specimen of 'the odium theologicum.
‘Quum credat' is ‘because they suppose?

38. Sed tempore sesto] ‘Sed' is ‘but to proceed,’ ‘but not to dwell
on the cause' (see xiii. 135, n., and beloW, verse 51). He goes on to
tell how at a festival oi the Ombites, when they were enjoying them-
selves and drunk, the Tentyrites fell upon them. They came up the
river no doubt in swarms, and took them by surprise. The chiefs
thought it a good occasion to spoil the enemy’s sport. ‘Ne sentirent,’
etc, shows what their intention was: to prevent their enjoying their
holiday, which sometimes lasted seven days and nights‚witl1tables
s read in the temples aud the streete. It was a religious festival.

uvenal speaks as a Roman when he says ‘toro' A mat would be all
that would be used in Egypt between the man and the baro ground.
‘Pervigili’ means that they went on all night.

44. Horrida sane Aegyptum] What is said is that Egypt is rude
enough; and yet in luxurions living the barbarians do not yield to the
hilamous Canopus. The rudeness seems to be indicated by ‘nigro'
and ‘qualiacunque ;’ the luxury, by ‘tibicine' aud ‘unguenta' Cano·
pus (i. ab, n.) was aseaport at the mouth oi the Canopic branch oi the
Nile. Itis no contradiction to speak of the barbariaus, as he calls
· them, of Upper Egypt not yielding to Canopus in profligacy. Canopus
was at this time full of Romans and other foreigners, and the habits of
that place would not represent those oi the Egyptians in general.

4⁷. Adde quod et sociiis victorio] The occasion was a good one for
annoying the enemy. ‘Madldus”f ‘ ngaderkess ‘madens' with or without

48. Inde virorum Satanas On the one side, there were men dancing

to the music ot' a black tluteplayer, periumes toi a certain sort), ·
flowers‚ and garlands; on the other side (the invading party), nothing =

but hatred and an empty belly. The perfumes oi the Orientals, like
their missio (see iii. 63, a), are offensive to the senses oi Europeans.
The Egyptians had the single and double flutes like those ot the
Greeks and Romans, but much longer. They were played by women
niore commonly than men. Dancing was usual on religione occasions,

51. Sed jurata poma] ‘Sed’ is used as above, verse 38. noer a
