18⁷. Plurima felix] He says, ‘⁴ Philosophy is the means os happi-
ness, sud by degrees divests us ol the greater part of natural deiecta
and all our saulis of judgmeut; ’twas she first taught us right from
wrong, lor certainly it’s only dwarfed, infirm, and little minds that love
revenge; which you may guther straight from this, that uo one likes it
better than a woman’' ‘ llioutus' is a participle, aud had better herc
he rendered as such ‘Vitis' are faults ornatore, some of which
cannot be eradicated. ‘Errores’ correspoud to ‘ culpas,' and are tsnlts
ot* practice. As to ‘ Sapientia,’ see ou verse 20.

192. Cur tornea] These lines are very vigorous. He begins to
illustrate what he said in the first tour lines. ‘Attonitos’ is used as
iu xii. 21. On ‘surdo’ see note ou vii. il. who Caedicius vas it is
impossible to say. The Scholiast tells ns he was a courtier and most
crnel satellite of Nero. Rhadamanthus was oue of the judges iu the
lower world. ·

199. Spartano cuidam respondit] This story is put hy Herodotus
into the mouth of Ieotychides, the Spartan, iu au address to tlte
Atheniens. He warns them against breaking their faith by relatiug
the iate of oue Glaucus who bore the highest reputation tor honesty
in all Sparta. A man of Miletus cume to him and said that, in con-
sequence os his reputatiou ior just dealing, he wished to deposit half
his fortune with him. Glaucus accepted the deposit, and promised to
restore the rnouey to any one who should produce certain tolrens arrd
claim it. This the man's sons afterwards did; bnt Glaucus proi'essed

‘to have forgotten all about the matter, and required iour months to
refresh his memory. This time he employed in coustdting the oracle
at Delphi as to whether he might not keep the money and swear he
had never received it. The answer of the oraclo was conveyed in
seven liexarneters denouncing dreadful punishment on the bresker ot'
oaths; and Glaucus, begging pardon ot' the god, paid the money. The

priestess did not let him go without a wholesome warning, saying, τὸ .

πειρηθῆναι τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὸ ποιῆσαι ἴσον diodotus, he who tcmpts God is as
bad as he who does the wickedness which it is iu his mind to do.
1e0tychtdes winds up his story hy saying that Glaucus had not one
descendant leit, but his whole house was extinct3 and his moralis
that a good man lias no other thought about a deposit than to return

’ it when it is called for.

· 200. qood dubitaret Depositum retinere] We should say ‘dubitavit
reddere,' he hesitated about restoring. But he also hesitated about
kesping the money, arrd thot was his offence.

209. Num scelus intra se tacitum] It has been thought that Juvenal
could not have got this sentiment without the light of Christianity, iu
the moral teachingof wliich no doubt it is asundamental rule. But the
ethica of Clwistianity are no new invention. They do but enforce
the teaching of conscience, which has only to be free and it will tell a
mart, without further revelation, that evil desires are sin, especially iu
the case that Juvenal supposes, where cowardice, not principle (mori-
bus, verse 204), prevents' the accomplishment oi thern. The Roman
law adopted the principle ol punishing t'or the intention to commit a

inre, just the same as if the crime were committed. But as a mau's
