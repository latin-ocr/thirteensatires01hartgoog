296. Ede abi consistas .·] He treats him as a Jew beggar, and aslis
. him where he posts himself to beg, in what ‘proseucha' he must look
lor him it he wants to find him. A ‘proseucha' was an oratory‚ a
building erected for the use oi those towns where there was no syna·
gogue, outside the walls by a stream or the sea-side, ior the benelit oi
ablution. It was used like the synagogae for reading the law and prayer
three times a day. In the Acts oi the Apostles (xvi. 13) thewriter says
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων ὲξὴλθομεν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως (Philippi) παρὰ ποταμὸν,
οὐ ἐνομίζετο προσευχὴ εἶναι, and there προσευχὴ is generally understood
to be a building of this sort. In the Gospel by St. Luke (vi. 12) our

’ Saviour is said to have passed the night ἑν τῇ προσευχῇ τοῦ Θεοῦ, where

also Whitby and other commentatore take προσευχὴ for a house of
prayer. As to the use of the present in ‘quaero’ Madvig says in his
‘Opusculaz' “ The Latina almost always use the present indicative

. when they are asking about a thing which they do not doubt that they

will do, or are asking the opinion of another in such a way that they
are not so much deliberating aa expressing a necessary judgment‚ or
are asking others what opinion they wish thern to hold.”

298. vadimonia deinde] After frightening the poor man out of his
sensas, they affect to be the injured parties, and declare they will have
the law of him. The stata oi the streets at night, even during the
time oi Augustus, was very disgraceful. Tacitus describes it in the
time of Nero, who himself set the example oi nightbrawling, which
was followed by many under the shelter of his name. The same tricks
were practised by Otho and other emperors.

305. subitusprassator ogit rem,] ‘Grassator' means ‘a highway-rob·
ber;’ and it appears from this place that the Pomptine Marshes and
the forest of Gallinaria were infested by banditti. Augustus took
, great pains to put them down, and so did Tiberius ; and itwould seem
from Juvenal's words that their planos having military posta in the
different places the robbers frequented was still pursued. Driveu out
, from the above haunts, they took up their abode in the city, where they
carried on their trade (which is the meaning oi ‘agit rem ')‚ breaking
into houses and murdering the inhabitants. ‘Subitus ’ seems to mean
that you start up from sleep, and find one oi these men by your bed
ready to cut your throat.

307, Et Pom tino palus et Gallinaria pianes] The Pomptinus Ager

‘on the' west, separated from the sea by a low range of hills ending in
the promontory oi Circeii, and bya lower ridge from that place to Ter·
racina. In the early period of Roman history it was fertile and popu-
lous 3 and when Appius made his road across it, about ac. 310, the
soil must have been firm. The character oi the country must have
changed at no great distance oi time. The neglect oi the middle
ages made the marshes worse than they ever were in the Roman
period. Various popes did something towards correcting the evil, the

ast of whom was Pius vl, whose works, begun in 1778 and continued
over a space ol sixteen years, are those to which the present drainage
