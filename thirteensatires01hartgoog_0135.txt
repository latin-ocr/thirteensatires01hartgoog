. 12. Hic, ubi nocturnae] ‘Constitue' ia used absolutely for making ..
an appointmcnt as we say, with either a dative ol the person or an ,

ablative with ‘cum' The nature of the appointment is usually ex-
pressed. Here it is easily understood. The grove where Nurnu is
said to have met his mistress and taaober Aegeria was close to the
Porta Capena. It had a lountain init. Numa was said to have built

ashrine there, and to have dedicated the whole to the Camenae, of u
whom Aegeria was one. It appears that the Jews, on paynrcnt of a ςΚ

’ certain rent, were allowed to inhabit this place when they wera for· t

bidden the city, as they were during the reign of Domitian. Tbey a

were so poor that he says their whole sumiture consisted in a basket

and a bed of hay. They were not allowed'to trade, and were driven, ,
it appears, to beg. From ‘cophinus' (κόφινος) are derived ‘coffin' ‘h

and ‘cullen’

15. Omnis enim populo] ‘Populo' means, ot course, the Romans. ᾗ

‘Merces' is the proper word for rent. Domitian was very severe in
collecting the taxes from the Jews. A poll-tax of two drachmae was
levied from all Jews and Christiana throughout the surpite. This
was lin addition to the ‘merces ;' it went to the ‘fiscua not to the

p lg. ejectis mendicat siloa Camenis] The Camenae to whom the wood
was dedicated, and who are here said to have been ejected to make
way for beggam, were not the Muses, though by the Latin poets the
two names are consounded, from Camenae being connected with Car·

nien in the sense of a prophecy. They were sour prophetie divinities ⁸ ’

peculiar toItaly. Their names were Antevorta, Postvorta, Carmenta,

La Caffarella. Itis one ol the sources ot the small river Ahno.
duvenal speaks os artificial grottos, but does not probably mean more
than one. He says it was not like a natural cave, and that the divin·

ity of the stream, or the spring where the divinity was supposed to t
live, would look much better if the fountain had a grass margin thera t

than with marble spoiltng the native stone. There was probably a

statue in that grotto representing the god, as there is stillio that t

mentioned above.

20. ingenuum violarent marmora tophum] ‘Tophus' is ‘roden-stone!
⁴ Ingenuum' means ‘plain unsophisticated,' and ‘violare' ‘to spoil'

25. ubi Daedalus caud alas& The legend of Daedalus flying from
Crete and alighting first at
Phoebus, is told by Virgil (Aen. vi. 14, sqq.). ,

27. Dum superest Lachesi] In the Greek conception of the Μοῖραι,
who according to Hesiod were three, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos,
it was Clotho’s business to spiu the thread of human life. Lachesis
determined the duration and condition ot it. But, as in Horace, the
three sisters are sometimes represented as spinning, and here Clotho’s
fonctions are usmped by Lachesis.
