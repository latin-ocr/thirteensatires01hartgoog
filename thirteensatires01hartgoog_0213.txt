tierricus drimie si coenaAIAtticus was· the cognomen of many per-
sons of high family and ‘stinction under the empire. The name
might be proverbial lor wealth from the enormous fortune of T. Pom-
ponius Atticus, the friend oi Cicero. Rutilus is a cognomen found in
several families, both patrician and plebeian. The owner of it here
had run through his fortune. ‘Lautus ' is herea munificent person
who lives well, but has means in proportion. ‘Excipitur ³ means ‘ is
taken up,’ as we say. As to Apicius, see iv. 23, n.

4. Convictus, thermae, stationes] In all companies there is tallr of
Rutilus. ‘Loquuntur’ is understood. ‘Convictus' is equivalent to
‘convivia' here, nnd iu other writers of the empire. ‘Thermae' are
the baths, where a great deal oi gossip went on. Places of public
resort, where people gathered for conversation, to meet friends and so
forth, as we do where hands play, were called ¹ stationes! .

6. Sufficiunt paleae] He means that while he might be doing his
country service in the field, he prefers letting himself to the ‘lanista’
‘Est' must be supplied after ‘ardens'

7. Non correcte quidem] ‘ Tribuno’ seems to he put ior the emperor.
Angustus prohibited senators from becoming gladiatore, while Nero
forced them to act as such. Here it is implied that though the em-
lplere}x did not compel the man as Nero, lte might heve prevented him
'e n ustus.

8. Scirpturus leges] The ‘lanista' was the traines who ‘also hired
gladiatore on his own account undera hond, the penalties of which
were very severe. They. are therefore called ‘regia verba,' the words
of a tyrant; ‘leges ' are his rules. ‘Fertur scripturus’ is, itis re·
ported he means to write them out, the rules to leam and the hond to
sign. Some take ‘regia verba' ior the words of command: “attolle,
caede, declina, urge, percute.”

12. Egregius coenat meliusque] ‘Caeteris ' may be understood. Egre-
gius ⁹ is an unusual comparatrve form, from ‘egregie' See M. tt, u,
obs. ; Z. 114, a, note. He says that those dine best who are poorest,
who are like an old house just ready to fall and letting in the light
through the cracks of the walls.

14. ¹gustus elementa per onznia] ‘Gustus' were the things eaten at the
‘promulsis ' to provoke the appetite. These persons got provocatircs
from water, air, and earth, fish, foul, and vegetables; and the more
they eost, the more in their hearts they relished their dainties.

17. Erec harrd difficile est] “ Well then (since nothing stops them) it
is not difficult to fetch the money which they are bent upon throwlng
