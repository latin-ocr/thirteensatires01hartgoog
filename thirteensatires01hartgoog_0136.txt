which was a proverbial way of speaking with theRomans as with us.

Govemnrent contracts have iu all times been profitable affairs. Juve-
nal speaks of men contracting for the repair of temples and shrines,
Ἴ as well as for clearing the beds of rivers, cleansing and keeping the
χ rewers, the repairing of harbure, and likewise for funerals, and for the
ξ sale of slaves by auction. Public works, which under the republio
¹ were looked after hythe aediles, had special officere (curatores) to
helillsdlltlfll‘tthfaletti lhlllillalhlltllltl ’
(redemptores) to carry out the necessary worlrs. The clearing of the
Tiber was particularly necessary from the quantity oi alluvial soil
brought down by the stream and the rapidity with which weeds
formed in the bed. The Cloaca Maxima, said to have been constructed
by Tarquinius Priscus, was large enough for a boat or a waggon of
hay to pass down it. The underground works of Rome were on
nearly as large ascale in proportiou as those of London. The cost of
keeping these drains in repair was very large; though the solid con-
struction of the Cloaca Maxima with stone arches, of which remains
still exist, left little to be done for that. On occasions when a puh-
lic funeral (‘ funus indictivum' or ‘censorium 'l was decreed, such aa
Tacitus often mentions, it was performed through a ‘redemptor,’
whose duty it would be to provide moumers (men and women), mu·
siciaus, ‘lectica’ and hearers, funeral pile, and every thing connected
with the procession, burning, and burial of the body, on such a scale
aethe senate might determine. ‘Busta' were places adjoining sep
ulchres, where the bodies were burnt.

A sale by auctiori ou the public account was conducted by a

‘praeco' in the presence of a public officer, aud a spear was set up
on the spot where the auctiori took place. It may have been called
‘domina’ in this place because the sale transferred to the purchaser
‘dominium' or ownership, in the thing purchased. The spear is said
to have been derived from the practice followed in old times in the
sellinges prisoners and booty on the field of battle. ‘Praebere' is
¹ herel ‘to put up to arction? The word ‘venalia' belonged especially
f tosaves. ’“
’ 34. Quondam li cornicines] These men started from the lowest be-
{illitasalteritalltllltltll{llltllltlt3.f.ls⁵.lll
were well known. “Now they give shows of gladiatore themselves:
and put men to death to please the people,'’ who, when a gladiator
had his adversary down, gave the signal for his despatch or to spere
him, by turning their thumbs up or down. The number of victims
at these shows was enormem, and they were never more frequent
than in the reign of Domitian. The expense lavished ou them was
likewise beyond belief.
