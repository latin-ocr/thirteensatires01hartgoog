municipium, and there Cicero was born, ac. 106. He was the first of

his gens (Tullia) that had curule honora, and was therefore ‘novus
homo' and ‘ignobihs' After him his family became ‘nobilis' He
was consul isc. 63, and in that year the conspiracy of Catilina was
formed. Cicero often alludes to his own connection with the eques-
, trien order. ‘Galeaturn' means with their helmets on ready for
action, asin i. 169. ‘Attonitis’ refers to the people, who knew noth-
ing of the reasons ior· such mensures. ‘In omni gente laborat' means
‘he cares for all people.' .

240. toga contulit iili] ‘Toga' is equivalent to peace, as is common.
‘Nominis et tituli’ is a common way of speaking, where a general

termis put first andaparticular form os it follows. The title was · κ

‘pater patriae’ Cicero was honored by Catulus and Cato addressing
him as ‘parens patriae) ‘And at that time,' Juvenal adds, ‘they
were free.’ He means that afterwards, when they gave itto Augustus
and to other emperors after him, they were not free> By Leucas he
means the battle of Actium, which place was about thirty miles north
of the island of Leucas or Leucadia. The other battle referred to is

. Philippi, which was in Thrace, but was included in the province of

Macedonia. ‘Thessaliae campis' therefore is an inaccuracy, proba-
bly arising from a confusion of Philippi with Pharsalia which Juvenal

· ahares with other authors. See Merivale, m 170, note 2. The original

name of Augustus was Ο, Octavius ; but he dropped this at his great
unole's death, and then he became C. Julius Caesar Octavianus, to
which the title of Augustus was added, ac. 27.

242 Octavia abstulit] The ‘non' which belongs tn this clause must
be supplied from the preceding.

245. Arpinas alius] This was O. Mariua, who was also born at
Arpinum of poor parents. He served in the cavalry at the siege of
Numantia under Scipio Africanus Minor. His military abilities raised
him to high estate, aud he married a great lady, Julia, the aunt of
xhim who was afterwards the Dictator, C. Caesar. The vine switch was
commonly used for military floggings ; and he says Marius had the
Witlcii imkeii over his head if he did his work lazily, which he was
not ie to o. .

248. {reniret castra dolabra] Although a body of ‘fabri’ ‘engi-
neers,' was attached to every Roman army, each ordinary foot soldier
carried a hatchet, an axe, asan, a basket, amattock, a knife, a leather ,
strap, and a chain, besides a stake for intrenchments and three days'
provision. ‘Securis' the hatchet, was a distinct thing from ‘dolabra'
which was a hatchet on one side, but had a pick on the other. On
the subjunctive, see A. 59, ὅ, b; M. 359; H. 486, 5. ¹

249. Hic tamea et Cimbros] For about six years the Romans were
kept in a state of great alarm by barbarian tribes from the north,
among whom the Cimbri were the most important. Marius was
recalled from Africa to oppose them. In rac. 102, in his fourth con·
sulship‚ he defeated and utterly destroyed the army of the Teutones
at Aquae Sextiae (Aia, near Marseillelr and in the following year,
being again consul, he and Q. Lutatius Catulus defeated the Cimbri
