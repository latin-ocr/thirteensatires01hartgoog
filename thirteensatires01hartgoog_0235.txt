away such fear than to put away the cause ot it Juvenal knew what
he was writing about.

107. sacro od delabro vocantem] “ lf you mistrnst him, and bid him
come to the temple and swear by the altar. he will go there before
you, nay, will be the first to challenge you to go there, and will abuse,
and perhaps strilre, you for doubting his honesty.'' The offended liar,
taking the character of inJ'ured innocence, is amusingly illustrated in
Falsmff. As to ‘superest' Gellius informs us that a misuse of the
word came into fashion, asin the expression ‘hic illi superest,’ ‘this is
that man’s advocate) On'some occasion the praetor, in reply to au
advocate who said ‘ego illi supersum‚' wittily retorted, ‘tu plane
superes, non ades,’a J'oke difficult to translate; but he meant to say
that the advocate was quite useless, for he was not doing an advocate’s
duty (adesse). ‘Fiducia' is confidence (in a good sense), confidence
in his own honesty.

110. Mirtum opit itta] ‘All the while he is only acting like the run-
’· away slave in some nrrnrus of Catullus,' who is referred to on viii.
186, with his plays Phasma and Laureolus. The name of the slave in
the play (here called ‘scurra '), the Scholiast says, was Vorenus. He
wasa great thief, and stole some money from a banker, on which
there is ajoke of which the point does not appear. ‘ Urbani’ is ‘witty.'

112. ut Stentora vincere possis] Stentor was the Greek herald with
the mighty voice in Homer; hrs voice was as lond as the shout of
fifty men. But Ares, when Diomed wounded him, according to the ,
poet, shouted as loud as nine thousand or ten thousand men in battle.

113. Audis, juppiter, lasso] ‘Labra nrovere’ is opposed to ‘mittere
vocem ; ’ the one is a suppressed cry hardly audible, the other loud.
‘Nec’ is ‘not even! .

115. Debueras] ‘It had been thy duty to spealr out hadst thou been
marble or bronze’ The nse of this form for ‘debuisses' has been
noticed above on iii. 163. As to Vagellius, the name occurs below,
xvi. 23. The person is unknown. The writer must have had some
statne in his mind. ‘The Scholiast says Vagellius was a great fool,
but like the gods he got a statue. ‘Omentum’ is properly the mem-
brane that covers the bowels, and the word is so used still. Here it
means the entrails.

120. Accipe quoa contro] He begs him to accept such consolation as
even hc', who professes to be no philosopher, never to have read the

Ἴ dogmas of Cynics or Stoice, and to be'no admirer of Epicurus, may

be able to offer him. The name of the Cynics was given them in the
time of their founder, Antisthenes, immediately after the death of
Socrates, his teacher. But the popular idea of their character is de
rived more from Diogenes of Sinope, the crabbed disciple of Antis-
thenes. The Stoic school was founded full threeouarters of ιι century
after the Cynio by Zeno, who had in his earlier studies attached him-
self to the Cynics, but modifled his opinions, and gare to the views of
that school a more general and expansive character. But the Stoics,
too. became more contracted under the successore of their founder,
aad in the popular notions ,ot J uvenal’s time. as in our own, there was

much difference between the two systema. J uvenal professes to
