SATIRE VIII.

Tua vice of aristocratia pretension is here represented with mode·
ration and good sense. There is no idle declamation against heredi-
tary honors; but the blindness of men belonging to an exclusive class,
whose claime to distinction were' founded upon the merits of the
grem and good of former generations and unsupported by any personal
merits of their own, is shown iu languago to which no one can object
and reasoning which admits of no answer. The Satire is in tlte form
of a letter addressed to one Pontius. He is one of the class against
whose degenerate members the Satire is directed ; and we may sup
ose he was a young man with what we should call good prospecta.
he pride of birth and the degeneracy of inberited nobility were not
new features of society in Juvenal's time, and they have not grown
so old ‚in ours but that generations to come will compluin as he did,
and pour contempt, as he did not, on the inheritunce of noble names,
however virtuous their possessore may be. There are some severe
lines on the Emperor Nero (ali-230), and the Satire was written
aiter his time, as the context shows; but how long it is impossible to
say. Certain references to military movements and victories would
seem to place it a little later than nn. 100.
