SATIRE XIII. ·

Α 1111111011 01 Juvenal’s, whom he calls Calvinus, 10 11 0 state oi grean
ercitement about a fraud practised upon him by 010 10 whom he had
given in trust a sum oi money, and who had denied the trust 01 oath.

uvenal writes to him ridiculing his wrath as mean and unphilosophi·
cal. The satire takes the form oi expostulation and ironical consolation
throughout. 1110 most l'amiliarly known as dealing with the subject oi
01 accusing conscience, which it does inavery poweriul way. But this
is only one part 01 the whole. The character 01 the times and the 001-
1100101 1110 past and the present occupy much oi the poem, and there is
0 very fine passage describing the way 11 which men tamper with guilt
and argue themselves into the commission oi it, and put on a bold iace 00
01 innoeence. There is no need oi the supposition that duvenal derived
the ideas 01 this satire from the doctrines 01 Christianity. There never

was a time when conscience did 1101 exist in the mind oi man, however ,

completely the habit oi guilt may have seared it in some and have
given 0 0010101 innocence to wickedness in the judgment 01 whole
c'ommunities. Whatd 11101111 says on the subJ'ect oi conscience derives
its only weight irom its truth; and though he exaggerates when he
leads to the inierence that the stings oi a guilty conscience must nec·
essarily follow guilt, the picture he draws is taken from experiente,
not from revelation, the experience 01 those who were no Chris·
tians and had no knowledge to frighten them but that which was
suggested from within. The soliloquy in which a man argues away
the misgivings with which he enters upon crime or the denisi
oi it, represents no doubt the conduct and teehngs 01 many who
have more light than that 01 0010010100; but there too the man
101010 bad Christian, but a bad pagam and 11 110 010 surprised

The reader had better take up this satire as representing the common
morslsense oi mankind, and look to the law oi Christianity 0000111111-
ing the unwritten law of which conscience has always been the guar·
dian and the exponent, and 01 which such writings as Juvenal's, espe-
cially this poem, are the 01001001 evidence. From v. 17 itis commonly
