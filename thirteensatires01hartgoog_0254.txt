sarmu'xrv. :235

Ultor was in the Forum Augusti. He says the people took to keeping
their money in Castor's temple ever since Mars the Avenger was
robbed of his hehnet,'and showed he couldn't take care of his own
’ property. Itis not known what act of sacrilege Juvenal is alluding
to. No doubt it was well understood. '

262. Erqo omnia Florae] As to the Megalesia or festival of Cybele,

Ι see'xi. la& they were celebrated in the early part of April. The

Floralia were celebrated at the end of the same mouth, and were at
tended with very waaron exhibitione. The Cerealia also were held in
April, and lasted one day. There were plays acted atall these festival,

, and that is the meaning of ‘aulaea'

265. jactata petozrro Corpora] ‘Petaurum’ is a Greek word πὲὁαυρον,
equivalent to μετέωρον, ‘up in the air! It appears to mean satage
from which persons took flying leaps. There was 'a spring perhaps
which helped the jumper, and explains ‘jactata corpora ' in this place.
In some cases a wheel was used, on the opposite sides of which two
persons hung, it would seem, and as the wheel went round one went
up and the other down. The ‘ rectus funis ' is the right rope. ‘Funam-
buli' or σχοινοβὰται, as the Greeks called them (iii. 77), carried their
art ιο great perfectiori at Rome.

267. Corycia sempor qui puppe] Corycia is put for Cilician, Corycus
being a promontory of Cilicia. Among the products of that country
largely exported to Rome was saffron. This explains ‘sacci olentis,’
the sweet-smelling bag. Corus and Auster are storm winds.

271. Passum et municipes Joais] ‘Passum’ was ‘raisin wine,’ for

which Crete was famous. The name is derived from ‘ganda' be:

cause the grapes were spread out to dry. The Cretans ha a Zeus of
their own. Rhea, to save the child she was ready to give birth to
from his father Crunos, hid herself in a cave of Mount Dicte or Ida
in Crete, with which island the early years of Zeus are commonly
connected (see xiii. 41). The wine-jars therefore are said to be coun-
{rymssn of Jove's, as the ‘siluri’ are called ‘municipes ' of Crispinus
iv.' t.

272. Hic tomen] That is, the ‘funambulus' The merchant follows
his rash trade to get a great deal of money and a great many houses,
while the other follows his to keep out cold and hunger. ‘Es' must
be understood after ‘ temerarius! ,

’ 276. plenam oiopais trabibus ηιανος] ‘Trabr' is sometimes used for a
ship. Juvenal says there are more men at sea than on shore. The
. use of the comparative where one branch of the comparison is not
expressed is common. The Carpathian sea was named from the island
Carpathos directly between Rhodes and Crete. Gaetulia bordered on

' the Atlantic and not on the Mediterraneum but ‘Gaetuli 'is commonly

used ior the Africana, and here ⁴ Gaetula aequora’ ir put loosely for

the African waters of the Mediterrancan. Mons Calpe is the present

Rock of Gibraltar. Juvenal says this multitude of ships will pass the

pillars of Hercules (of which Calpe was one and Abyla on the African

coast was the other) and hear the sun hissing as he sets in the western

gatera. (gire final vowel in ⁴ Calpe' is short, though it represents the
reek K' πη. -
