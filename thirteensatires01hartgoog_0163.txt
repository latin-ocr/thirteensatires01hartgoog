are here represented as drinking to their heroes' mernory in tha

nt occasions.

38. Heliadum crustas] Ovld relates how the three daughters of the
Suu, Pha'e'thusa, Lampetie, aud Phoebe, wept for their brother Phae·
ton on the banks of the Eridanus, aud were turned into poplars from
which tears came forth aad were hardeued by the sun into amber,
‘succinum' or ‘electrum' ‘Crustas’ were probably platee of thin
metat, as the name implies, as distinguished from ‘emblemata' or
figures laid on the vessel.

inaequales beryllo The beryl is a species oi emerald. ‘inaequales'
means ‘'embossed. ‘Phiala' was the Greek name corresponding to
the Latin ‘patera' abroad, flat cup for drinking or libatiou. Our word
‘vral’ is derived from it. Virro is the great inan.

42. iaspis] Jasper is a species of quartz varying through all colors,
and opeque. ‘Da veniam,' “ you may excuse the master for watclting
lus caps, for they hare rare genis on them.'' The words ‘da veniam
- iaspis,’ may be those of the servant to the guest, ‘⁶ Excase me, but
thatl cup has a fine stone ou it,'’ giving him a hint, as a saucy fellow
mig rt.

Vatinius, rose by low means to high favor with Ner03 and it appears
that'his name for some reason was given to aparticular kind of cup
(nasitema), perhaps from its having one or more nozzles equal in
length to his nose, which Martial says was along one. ‘Nasorum '-
quatuor’ is a genitive of quality.

50. decocta& Boiled water cooled down with snow.

52 cursor 'astulasl He complains that the guest is served by a
black outrunner‚ brought in to wait at table, while the master has
ahandsome slave to attend upon him.

2 Ancus.'' Nearly the whole reign of Tullus Hostilius was passed in
’ wars with the Albane, Sabinas, and other neighbors.

62. Digna supercilia] They justify his pride, called ‘supercilium'
from the motion of the eyebrow by which it is expressed.

64„ Qerippe indignatur] ‘Quippe’ is formedfrom ‘quia' as ‘nempe'
from ‘nam,' and both mean ‘certainly,' ‘of course,' ‘you kn0W,' but
with a causal sense included. On the mode of ‘ poscas,' see references
on iii. 3, ‘destinet' and add M. 397.
