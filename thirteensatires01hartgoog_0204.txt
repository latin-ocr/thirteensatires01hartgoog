“How fortunate a natal day was thine,
· In that late consulate, O'Rome, of mine 1 ”

Juvenal says it he had never said a better thing than that he might
have snapped his fingere at Antonius, quoting his own words (Phil. ii.
46); “Contempsi Catilinae gladios, non pertimescam tuos'' On the
use oi ‘potuit’ consult A. 69, 3, e; H. om, 2, l; Β. 1274. The pre·
ceding verse might be taken as the 'subiect of this verb, by a not
uncommon figure, a man's way of speaking being put for the man
himself. He adds, he would rather have been the author of his ridic-
ulous poetry than of that Phiiippic which he calls divine, famous, ,and
so forth. This speech was written in September, ac. 44, as a rejoin-
der to Antonius's reply tothe first Philippic. Cicero did not attend
the meeting oi the Senate at which Antonine spoke, and though this
speech professes to be an extemporaneous reply, it was never deliv-
ered, but written in the country, nor did Cicero venture to publish it .
immediately. ‘Volveris’ means ‘ you are read ;' ‘aprima proxima'
is a way of cx ressing the second.

126. iilum dairas eripuit] After the death cf Alexander, Demos-
thenes used all his eloqueuuce to produce a general rising of the Greek
states against Antipater, the successor to the Macedonian division of
Alexandcr's kingdom, and succeeded. But the resistance of the
Greeks was not effectual, and, rather than fall into the hands of An·
tipater, Demosthenes poisoned himself, nc. 322.

128. traderentcmfroeaa theatri} The popular assemblies (ἐκκλησίαι)
were held iu the Pnyx, as ace o ground near the Areiopagus, tili the
building of the theatre of ionysus in the Lenaea, about rac. 340, after
which the assemblies were commonly held in the theatre. It was
finished in Demosthenes's time, and he must often have spoken there.

129. Dis ille odaersis] This is a common way of speaking. Demos·

· thenes’s father was a man of property, and died when his son was

seven years old. What Juvenal says here therefore isa mere donr-
ish. He was the owner of a swerd or knife manufactory‚ which
Juvenal has'made the most of.

133. truncis affixo tropaeis] His next ease is tha vanity of military
glory. The practice of erecting trophies after victories wss very
,ancient in Greecc, and adopted by the Romans late in the republican .
times. They were composed of arms taken from the enemy and piled
up usually ou the trunk oi a tres or some low wood'en frame. ‘Buc-
culae' are the cheeks of a helmet which were buttoned under the chin.

‘Bnckle’ is derived from this word. ‘Cassis' is properly a helmet of '

metal, ‘ galea' of leather. Some ‘galeae' had virors which covered

t . the face.

135. Et canum temone jupam] A war chariot shom of its pole.
‘Curium ' is not used elsewhere with anoun after it, bnt it is properly
aparticiple. ‘Apiustre ' is the curved ornament which most ancient
ships carried on their stem, commonly of a fan shape, and not unlike
the feathers of a Red Indian chief. Sometimes it was wreathed with

flowers, sometimes it carried a flag or a laniem. ‘Huuranis majora'
